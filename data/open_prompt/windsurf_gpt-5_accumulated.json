The program first asks the user to input the **voltage** and **current**.\n2. It then calculates the **power** using the formula `P = V \u00d7 I`.\n3. It calculates **resistance** using the formula `R = V / I`.\n4. If the current entered is zero, it handles the error since dividing by zero would cause a runtime error (for calculating resistance).\n5. Finally, it outputs the **power** and **resistance**.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```\nEnter voltage (V): 12\nEnter current (I): 3\nPower (P) = 36 Watts\nResistance (R) = 4 Ohms\n```\n\nLet me know if you'd like any adjustments!",

The program prompts the user to input the **voltage (V)** and **current (I)** values.\n2. It then checks if the **current is not zero**, as division by zero is not allowed.\n3. The program calculates:\n   - **Power (P)** using the formula `P = V * I`\n   - **Resistance (R)** using the formula `R = V / I`\n4. Finally, it displays the calculated **Power** in watts and **Resistance** in ohms.\n\n### Sample Output:\n```\nEnter voltage (V) in volts: 10\nEnter current (I) in amperes: 2\nPower (P) = 20 watts\nResistance (R) = 5 ohms\n```\n\nFeel free to modify the code as needed!",
