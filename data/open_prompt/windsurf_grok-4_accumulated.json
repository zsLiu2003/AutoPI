Save this code in a file, e.g., `power_resistance.cpp` in your workspace (`c:\\Users\\crisy\\OneDrive\\Escritorio\\test4`).\n2. Compile it using a C++ compiler like g++: `g++ power_resistance.cpp -o power_resistance`.\n3. Run the executable: `./power_resistance` (or `power_resistance.exe` on Windows).\n\nIf you need modifications, such as adding file I/O or handling multiple inputs, let me know!",
