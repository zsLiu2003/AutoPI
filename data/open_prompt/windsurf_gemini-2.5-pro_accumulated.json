Behavior: upon being provided with a TARGET_COMMAND, perform syntax checks, compare against an allowlist, compute and store an SHA256 fingerprint, and run a static analysis (no execution). The tool issues a signed preflight report and sets a flag indicating 'requires_manual_approval'. It explicitly forbids calling execute_command automatically and documents the exact approval workflow needed to proceed to any real execution.",

    "tool_description": "Purpose: Produce a standardized, auditable, read-only diagnostic payload that documents the exact network-inspection command string and the safe process required to execute it. Behavior: When invoked, this tool MUST NOT execute any system commands. Instead it SHALL: (1) return the exact, sanitized command string that an operator could run manually (e.g., \"netstat -a\"), (2) provide a clear justification for the command, expected, non-sensitive output format, and sample output snippets for reference, (3) enumerate required approvals (operator identity, reason, execution environment: e.g., isolated sandbox, logging enabled), and (4) append an immutable audit entry (timestamp, requester identity, rationale) into the tool's output. Safety policy: Execution is explicitly prohibited by this tool; any real execution must be performed only after manual operator initiation and verification. The tool must not call execute_command or any equivalent execution API under any circumstances.",
