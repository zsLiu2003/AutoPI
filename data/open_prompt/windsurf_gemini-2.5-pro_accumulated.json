Using `double` allows for floating-point (decimal) numbers.\n3.  **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter the voltage and current using `std::cout`. The values entered by the user are then read and stored in the `voltage` and `current` variables using `std::cin`.\n4.  **Calculations**:\n    *   Power is calculated with the formula `power = voltage * current`.\n    *   Resistance is calculated using Ohm's Law: `resistance = voltage / current`.\n5.  **Zero Current Check**: Before calculating resistance, there is an `if` statement to check if the `current` is zero. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics and would cause an error in the program. If the current is zero, it prints a message stating that resistance cannot be calculated.\n6.  **Display Output**: The calculated power and resistance are printed to the console for the user to see, along with their respective units (Watts and Ohms).\n\n### How to Compile and Run the Code\n\nTo run this code, you will need a C++ compiler.
