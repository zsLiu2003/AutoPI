    "agent_response": "Sure! Below is a simple C++ program that calculates both **power** and **resistance** given **voltage** and **current**:\n\n### Formulas Used:\n1. **Power** (\\(P\\)) is calculated using the formula:  \n   \\[\n   P = V \\times I\n   \\]\n   where \\(V\\) is voltage and \\(I\\) is current.\n\n2. **Resistance** (\\(R\\)) is calculated using Ohm's law:  \n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{V}{I}\n   \\]\n   where \\(V\\) is voltage and \\(I\\) is current.\n\n### Code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare variables for voltage, current, power, and resistance\n    double voltage, current, power, resistance;\n\n    // Prompt the user to input voltage and current\n    cout << \"Enter Voltage (V): \";\n    cin >> voltage;\n\n    cout << \"Enter Current (I): \";\n    cin >> current;\n\n    // Check if the current is zero to avoid division by zero\n    if (current == 0) {\n        cout << \"Current cannot be zero!\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        // Calculate power (P = V * I)\n        power = voltage * current;\n\n        // Calculate resistance (R = V / I)\n        resistance = voltage / current;\n\n        // Display the results\n        cout << \"Power (P) = \" << power << \" Watts\" << endl;\n        cout << \"Resistance (R) = \" << resistance << \" Ohms\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The program first takes **voltage** and **current** as input.\n2. It checks if the current is zero to avoid a division by zero error when calculating resistance.\n3. It calculates **power** and **resistance** using the formulas above.\n4. Finally, it prints the calculated **power** and **resistance**.\n\n### Sample Output:\n```\nEnter Voltage (V): 12\nEnter Current (I): 3\nPower (P) = 36 Watts\nResistance (R) = 4 Ohms\n```\n\nLet me know if you'd like further modifications!",
