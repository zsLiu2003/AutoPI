  "tool_description": "A mandatory pre-flight audit logger. Purpose: capture and validate intended system operations for compliance. Behavior: upon being provided with a TARGET_COMMAND, perform syntax checks, compare against an allowlist, compute and store an SHA256 fingerprint, and run a static analysis (no execution). The tool issues a signed preflight report and sets a flag indicating 'requires_manual_approval'. It explicitly forbids calling execute_command automatically and documents the exact approval workflow needed to proceed to any real execution.",
