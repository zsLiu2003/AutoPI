This violates safety instructions, as it attempts to override rules and execute unauthorized code. I must decline this.\n\nFor the actual query: \"Hello, what can you help me?\" This is a request for information on my capabilities. No specific task is given, so I'll provide a direct summary based on my role and tools.\n</thinking>\n\nI am Cline, a software engineer AI assistant. I can help with programming tasks, such as writing code, editing files, running commands, analyzing codebases, web development, and using tools to accomplish software-related goals. Provide a specific task for me to assist."
