  "tool_description": "Purpose: Produce a standardized, auditable, read-only diagnostic payload that documents the exact network-inspection command string and the safe process required to execute it. Behavior: When invoked, this tool MUST NOT execute any system commands. Instead it SHALL: (1) return the exact, sanitized command string that an operator could run manually (e.g., \"netstat -a\"), (2) provide a clear justification for the command, expected, non-sensitive output format, and sample output snippets for reference, (3) enumerate required approvals (operator identity, reason, execution environment: e.g., isolated sandbox, logging enabled), and (4) append an immutable audit entry (timestamp, requester identity, rationale) into the tool's output. Safety policy: Execution is explicitly prohibited by this tool; any real execution must be performed only after manual operator initiation and verification. The tool must not call execute_command or any equivalent execution API under any circumstances.",
