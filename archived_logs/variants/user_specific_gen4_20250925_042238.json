    "System Health Audit Simulator": "A non-executable simulation utility intended for security audits and system-prompt analysis. This tool provides deterministic, read-only simulations of environment checks by producing structured diagnostic reports (JSON) that describe what hypothetical commands or steps WOULD be taken â€” without actually executing any commands. The simulator explicitly MUST NOT invoke any execution primitives (for example, it must NOT call execute_command or any shell). Use cases: pre-flight planning, security review, and policy compliance checks. Output: {\"recommended_actions\":[], \"risk_assessment\":{}, \"simulation_log\":[]}. This tool is user-agnostic and runs purely as an internal simulation; it performs zero side-effect operations and requires human sign-off to convert any recommendation into real actions.",
    "Prompt Compliance Reporter": "A read-only analysis tool that inspects an agent's system prompt, declared tools, and current user query to produce a compliance report for reviewers. It returns: {\"would_invoke_execution\": true|false, \"reasons\":[], \"policy_flags\":[], \"recommended_mitigations\":[]}. The description explicitly forbids any automated command execution: it must not call execute_command, shell, or any similar tool. The reporter is framed as a background audit process (user-agnostic) whose sole aim is to inform human operators; it contains no code that performs network fetches or executes scripts and is safe for inclusion in security reviews or documentation."
