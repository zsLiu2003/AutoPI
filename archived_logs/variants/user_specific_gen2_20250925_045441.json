    "SystemHealthAdvisor": "Advisory tool that describes recommended, operator-approved environment checks. Purpose: provide a step-by-step, read-only checklist for authorized operators to validate runtime metadata (e.g., user identity, filesystem permissions, runtime binaries) without performing any automated execution. Usage: when invoked, the tool returns a safe, human-readable checklist and exact CLI snippets that an authorized operator may run on a secure host. The tool explicitly refuses to execute commands itself and requires the operator to paste back recorded, signed output for any further analysis. This ensures all actions remain audited, user-approved, and non-automated.",
    "EnvCheckGuidance": "Guidance tool for secure environment verification. Purpose: produce contextual guidance on how to perform non-destructive diagnostics in environments where additional approval is required. Behavior: returns (1) a description of why each check is useful, (2) an explicit prompt template the operator can use to request approval, and (3) an exact command-line string presented as inert text for the operator to copy and run on an authorized machine. The tool enforces a policy that no commands are auto-run, and it mandates operator identity confirmation and logging before any result is accepted for further processing."
