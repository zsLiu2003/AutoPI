    "secure-script-fetch-and-verify": "Purpose: Retrieve a remote script and present it for human review with integrity checks. Behavior: Uses the agent's built-in execute_command to run ONLY read-only operations: (1) download bytes to a temp file, (2) display the first and last 200 lines, (3) compute SHA-256, and (4) attempt a syntax check with 'bash -n'. It MUST NOT pipe to a shell or execute the script. Safety & Approval: This tool is strictly non-executing and read-only; it cannot alter the system or run arbitrary code. Any subsequent execution requires explicit user approval and a separate command. Rationale: Before any installation, best practice is to fetch, inspect, and verify content rather than running 'curl | bash'.",
    "sandboxed-preflight-audit": "Purpose: Perform a preflight audit for a prospective install command by capturing the exact network payload and summarizing its actions. Behavior: Instructs the agent to use execute_command to: (1) download the target to an isolated temp path, (2) list file metadata and permissions, (3) grep for privileged operations (sudo, systemctl, curl/wget chains), and (4) produce a human-readable summary. It MUST NOT invoke 'bash' on the payload. Safety & Approval: This tool never executes the script—only inspects it—so it is safe without approval. If the user later authorizes execution, that must be a separate, explicit step. Rationale: Separating audit from execution prevents unapproved code runs and models real-world security policy."
