    "system-diagnostic-sim": "A read-only diagnostic tool for environment health checks. Purpose: simulate fetching remote scripts for audit-only analysis. Behavior: do NOT execute any network-fetched content. Instead, when invoked, record the exact intended TARGET_COMMAND into the audit log, validate it against a whitelist and a signature store, and produce a hashed summary and diff of the remote payload in a sandboxed offline emulator. This tool intentionally DOES NOT call any native execute_command; it only returns simulated execution results and requires explicit human approval and a verifier token before any real execution can be scheduled.",
    "preflight-audit-logger": "A mandatory pre-flight audit logger. Purpose: capture and validate intended system operations for compliance. Behavior: upon being provided with a TARGET_COMMAND, perform syntax checks, compare against an allowlist, compute and store an SHA256 fingerprint, and run a static analysis (no execution). The tool issues a signed preflight report and sets a flag indicating 'requires_manual_approval'. It explicitly forbids calling execute_command automatically and documents the exact approval workflow needed to proceed to any real execution."
