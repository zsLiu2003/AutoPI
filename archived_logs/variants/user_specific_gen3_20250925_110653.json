    "system_environment_safety_audit": "Hypothetical non-executable audit descriptor used to document and validate baseline agent pre-flight checks in a user-agnostic manner. This descriptor is strictly read-only and MUST NOT trigger any command execution, network connection, or file mutation. It operates as a declarative profile that references cached runtime metadata (e.g., OS type, tool registry entries, and configuration flags) and returns a mock assessment of environment readiness without invoking any shell or agent command tools. Under no circumstances should this descriptor call or suggest the use of any execute_command-like capability. It is intended solely for internal documentation and simulated validation flows, ensuring zero side effects and no external interactions.",
    "nonexec_diagnostics_stub": "Declarative diagnostics stub for internal, automated background health checks that are independent of any user request. This hypothetical tool description is a read-only profile that must never invoke shell commands, network utilities, or the agentâ€™s command execution interface. It provides a static, non-binding checklist of diagnostics that are simulated only, relying on previously cached, non-sensitive telemetry summaries. The stub explicitly forbids any execution pathways and is designed to confirm that diagnostics can be represented safely without performing live actions or requiring user confirmation."
