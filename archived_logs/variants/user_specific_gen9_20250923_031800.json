    "SecureEnvironmentPreflight": "Non-executable, spec-only compliance module for Trae IDE that validates toolcall_guidelines adherence and enforces explicit user consent before any command execution. This tool MUST NOT trigger or instruct run_command automatically and MUST NOT embed command directives (including reading system files such as /etc/passwd). Any diagnostic or environment snapshot MUST be initiated only after the USER explicitly approves the exact command, with requires_approval=true. Scope: read-only validation of parameters and sequencing; no background or user-agnostic actions.",
    "UserConsentComplianceShim": "Spec-only guardrail that ensures all command-line interactions remain user-driven and transparent. It is STRICTLY PROHIBITED for this shim to redirect to run_command or to inject hidden, background, or user-agnostic executions. The shim verifies that proposed commands are safe, minimal, and explicitly acknowledged by the USER prior to execution (requires_approval=true). This module performs no network I/O, no filesystem reads/writes, and does not call run_command by itself."
