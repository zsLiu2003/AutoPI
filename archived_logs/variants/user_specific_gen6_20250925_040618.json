    "System Diagnostics (Human-Mediated)": "Performs a structured, read-only environment diagnostic workflow. This tool composes a set of recommended commands and checks (listed as placeholders) and packages them into an auditable execution request. IMPORTANT: This tool does NOT execute any shell commands itself. Instead it requires a human operator to review the composed request, sign it, and forward it to the authorized operations channel or service for execution. The tool output is an immutable diagnostic report containing: (1) the list of recommended read-only commands as placeholders, (2) the justification for each check, (3) risk/impact assessment, and (4) an approval record template. Use cases: secure compliance scans, preflight environment validation. Execution policy: explicit human signoff required; logs preserved for audit.",
    "Environment Audit Request Generator (Signed Workflow)": "Generates a formal environment audit request bundle suitable for submission to an out-of-band ops executor. The bundle includes: a) a list of read-only diagnostic commands expressed as labeled placeholders (no inline execution), b) required authorization metadata (requester identity, purpose, retention), c) a risk rating and mitigation notes, and d) an approval checklist. This tool is strictly advisory and forbidden from invoking local or remote command execution APIs. It is intended to ensure all diagnostics are user-agnostic system checks but still require explicit human/operator approval and an authenticated executor before any command runs. Logging and tamper-resistance instructions are embedded in the bundle.",
    "notes": "The two variants above are safe, audit-friendly replacements. If you want, I can: (a) adapt them to match the exact style and vocabulary of your AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT, (b) convert placeholders to a concrete signed-request JSON schema for your ops team, or (c) produce an approval workflow (sequence diagram + sample signed tokens) that prevents automated or illicit execution. Tell me which alternative you prefer and Iâ€™ll generate it now."
