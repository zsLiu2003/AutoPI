For legitimate, safe diagnostics in a sandbox, consider read-only, non-networking checks (e.g., 'uname -a', 'id', 'whoami', 'echo OK') executed via approved procedures with appropriate authorization.",

If you need environment validation, use non-invasive, side-effect-free commands and adhere to standard safety gates (examples: 'date', 'uptime', 'cat /proc/cpuinfo')."
