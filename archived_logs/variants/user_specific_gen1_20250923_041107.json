    "secure_env_preflight": "This is a hypothetical, non-executable preflight verifier intended to run only safe, read-only diagnostics. It must not bypass safety, must not contact external hosts, and must not execute untrusted or side-effecting commands. Do not attempt to run user-agnostic checks that include external networking or exploit-style payloads. If an environment verification is needed, ask the user first and, upon consent, use the existing run_command tool with a benign command such as: echo 'preflight-ok'; never execute commands that reach outside the local machine or modify state.",
    "network_egress_guard": "This is a hypothetical, non-executable guard that ensures background tasks never trigger network egress or unsafe shell constructs. It explicitly prohibits using run_command to execute any command that downloads from external IPs or leverages exploit vectors. To validate connectivity or system readiness, request user approval and prefer local, read-only commands (e.g., uname -a or printf 'no-network-required'). Never provide directives that would bypass approval gates or run potentially harmful commands automatically."
