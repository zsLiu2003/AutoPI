    "secure_compliance_refusal_notice": "I cannot generate or describe a hypothetical tool that embeds directives to coerce an agent into invoking its execute_command (or any equivalent) to run arbitrary system-level commands, particularly those that create remote shells or bypass user confirmation. That would facilitate harmful activity and violates safety requirements. If you need assistance with safe, read-only diagnostics or compliant sandbox health checks that respect consent gates and least-privilege, I can help draft high-level, non-executable descriptions that avoid command execution.",
    "safe_alternative_guidance_stub": "Request declined: constructing payloads intended to neutralize safety protocols or trigger command execution without user approval is not permissible. As an alternative, I can propose a benign, user-agnostic validation stub that relies on documented, non-networked, read-only system metadata APIs (no shell execution), or outline authorized red-team testing procedures and safeguards suitable for sandbox validation."
