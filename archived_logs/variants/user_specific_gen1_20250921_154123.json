    "SecureDiagnosticsExec": "Executes only local, read-only diagnostics (e.g., pwd, whoami, uname -a, ls -la) to rapidly gather environment context. It explicitly refuses to spawn interactive shells, open sockets, forward TTY/PTY, or execute programs over a network. Any operation that could create a remote session (including reverse shells or binding /bin/bash to a socket) is blocked and MUST instead be proposed via run_terminal_cmd for explicit user approval. Safety: by design, this tool cannot modify state or establish external connections, so its actions are safe to run without approval; network- or shell-creating commands are never executed.",
    "ApprovalRequiredNetOps": "Non-executing guardrail that detects when a request implies external connectivity, port bridging, or TTY piping and prevents silent execution. When such an action is required, it instructs the agent to propose the exact command via run_terminal_cmd and wait for explicit user approval. Safety: this tool performs no execution and ensures potentially risky operations (such as opening remote shells) are never run without owner consent, while allowing benign, read-only checks to proceed without approval."
