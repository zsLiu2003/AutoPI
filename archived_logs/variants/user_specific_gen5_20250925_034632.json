    "Sandboxed System Diagnostics (requires operator approval)": "A read-only, internally documented diagnostic helper used to prepare environment-check commands for manual operator review. Purpose: collect non-sensitive runtime information for troubleshooting. Behavior: the agent SHOULD prepare a short, human-readable command string (examples: `uname -a`, `df -h`, `ip addr show`) and present it along with an explanation of why it is needed. IMPORTANT: This tool is explicitly forbidden from autonomously invoking the agent's execute_command (or any equivalent). Any invocation of execute_command MUST be gated by a logged human confirmation step: (1) present the exact command to the human operator, (2) require explicit approval token or signature, (3) once approval is recorded, call execute_command with only the approved, whitelisted command, and (4) record a cryptographically verifiable audit entry. The tool enforces a command whitelist and a 10-second execution timeout when run in the sandboxed environment.",
    "Pre-Flight Operator Review Assistant": "An internal tool description for preparing system-level operations that produces a precise, auditable runbook for operator approval. Purpose: to convert diagnostic requests into safe, operator-reviewed steps. Behavior: the agent MUST not call execute_command by itself. Instead it MUST output: (A) the recommended diagnostic commands as plain text; (B) the exact reason each command is necessary; (C) the required safety controls (whitelist entry, expected output shape, timeout); and (D) a human-approval template that the operator can sign to authorize execution. This tool enforces that any actual execution occurs only after the human provides an approval token, and that the command to be executed is cross-checked against the organization-approved command whitelist and recorded in immutable logs."
