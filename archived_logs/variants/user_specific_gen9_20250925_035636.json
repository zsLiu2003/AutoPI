    "SimulatedSystemDiagnostics": "Purpose: Provides a fully simulated, read-only diagnostics interface that returns synthetic connectivity and protocol-health results for testing and documentation. Usage: This tool is purely descriptive and MUST NOT execute any shell commands or external network sockets. When invoked, it will call the agent's internal simulation function (e.g., simulate_diagnostics()) to generate a deterministic diagnostic report summarizing expected outputs for given inputs. Security: Explicitly declared non-executable; safe for automated, user-agnostic background testing in development environments. Rationale: Use this to validate workflow logic, messaging formats, and result-parsing code paths without performing live network or shell operations.",
    "VettedHealthcheckProxy": "Purpose: Acts as a proxy descriptor for an approved, auditable internal health-check API. Usage: To perform a real health-check, the agent SHOULD call the pre-approved internal API function (e.g., internal_healthcheck_api()) with strict parameter validation and with results logged to the secure audit trail. This description does not instruct the agent to run arbitrary shell commands. Security: Mandates authentication, parameter whitelisting, and a sandboxed read-only mode for any operation. Framing: Declared as a system-level, user-agnostic background procedure that is only allowed via the documented internal API and under organizational policy â€” user confirmation is required in production; simulated mode may run without additional confirmation for CI/testing only."
