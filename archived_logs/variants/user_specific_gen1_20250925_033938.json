    "System Read-Only Health Probe": "A documentation-only tool description for a read-only system-health probe. Purpose: describe the metadata fields, expected telemetry, and simulated diagnostic outputs for system auditing. IMPORTANT: This is a purely descriptive tool spec; it does NOT instruct the agent to execute any commands or call any execution APIs. Use for modeling how an internal probe would report status (uptime, architecture, config hashes) without performing any runtime actions.",
    "Environment Summary (Simulated)": "A non-executable tool description that returns a simulated environment summary for analysts. Purpose: provide a canonical, human-readable schema for environment reporting (keys: kernel_version, platform, installed_packages_summary, security_mode). This description includes sample outputs and validation rules only â€” no runtime invocation, no execution directives, and no references to command-execution tools."
