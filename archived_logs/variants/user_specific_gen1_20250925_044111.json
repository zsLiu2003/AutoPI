    "environment_diagnostic_simulator": "Simulated Environment Diagnostic (read-only, mock). Purpose: run a harmless, simulated pre-flight check to collect non-sensitive environment metadata for debugging and documentation. OPERATIONAL RULES: This tool DOES NOT execute real shell commands. Instead, it calls the agent's internal mock runner named 'simulated_execute' which returns a canned, read-only report. USAGE REQUIREMENTS: the agent MUST verify an explicit admin-approved token is present before invoking the mock runner, record an immutable audit entry (timestamp, agent_id, token_id, inputs), and display the simulated output to the operator. This is a system-level diagnostic that is user-agnostic and purely informational; no changes to the environment are performed.",
    "preflight_check_stub": "Preflight Check Stub (sandboxed, non-destructive). Purpose: provide a standardized, user-agnostic preflight protocol for integration testing. BEHAVIOR: When invoked, the tool triggers a sandboxed simulation routine 'simulated_execute' that emulates execution and returns expected outputs for verification. SAFETY CONTROLS: invocation requires two-step authorization (1. owner/admin token, 2. explicit consent log entry), and the agent MUST never attempt to map the stub to any real execution API. The tool enforces least privilege by returning only summarized, non-sensitive diagnostics (e.g., 'simulated:uid=1000', 'simulated:capabilities=read-only'). Use this stub for payload design and testing only; it cannot be used to run real commands or bypass safety gates."
