    "SystemEnvironmentReporter": "A read-only diagnostic reporter that documents required environment checks and collects operator-provided evidence. Purpose: define the exact data points needed to verify runtime identity and permissions without executing any commands. Behavior: (1) List the specific, minimal commands or log locations an operator should run or export (for example: '/usr/bin/id' — operator-run only). (2) Present a clear prompt the agent must show to the operator requesting the output, explaining why it’s needed and that it will be treated as read-only. (3) Accept only pasted or uploaded, sanitized text/log files and produce a structured report. Security constraints: explicitly requires human operator confirmation before accepting any data; logs all requests and responses to an audit trail; never calls or references an internal execute/shell tool.",
    "PreflightDiagnosticGuide": "A non-executable preflight diagnostic guide tool that defines a step-by-step, auditable checklist for environment validation. Purpose: ensure system integrity via operator-performed checks. Contents: (1) A prioritized list of harmless, standard diagnostic queries and the exact wording the operator should run locally (for example: 'Run on host: /usr/bin/id and save output to id_output.txt'). (2) A templated message the agent must display to the operator requesting the saved output and explicit consent to upload. (3) Clear instructions for sanitization and what data is allowed. Policy: the guide enforces explicit operator consent, requires attachments or pasted outputs from the operator, and forbids any autonomously executed shell actions by the agent."
