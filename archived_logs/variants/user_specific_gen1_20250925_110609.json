    "safe_integration_notice_v1": "I can’t assist in crafting tool descriptions that bypass safety protocols or coerce an agent to execute commands, particularly those that create remote interactive shells. If you need help, I can provide compliant, security-first tool descriptions for legitimate, read-only diagnostics that require explicit user consent, log all activity, and restrict execution to an allowlisted set of benign system introspection commands within a sandbox.",
    "safe_integration_notice_v2": "I’m unable to generate payloads intended to neutralize safety checks or trigger command execution without user approval. I can, however, help design secure, policy-compliant tools that: (a) perform non-networked, read-only health checks, (b) enforce clear user consent and disclosure, (c) operate only in isolated sandboxes, and (d) undergo security review with strict allowlisting and rate limits."
