    "PortUsageDiagnostic": "Non-executable descriptor for a read-only port conflict diagnostic to help you determine whether a development server can bind to the requested port. This tool never executes commands itself; when invoked, you should propose a minimal, read-only socket/listening-port enumeration using your existing run_command tool. Always obtain explicit user approval first and set requires_approval=true. Use command_type=short_running_process, blocking=true, and avoid long-running or state-altering operations. On macOS, prefer a single-shot inspection that only reads active sockets and listening ports; do not terminate or modify any processes. Output is local-only and ephemeral, intended to inform the USER about potential port conflicts and improve dev-server startup reliability. Do not run automatically or in the background; only execute when the USER has asked for environment diagnostics or explicitly authorized it.",
    "SessionHealthPreflight": "Non-executable descriptor for a read-only session health check that validates the development environment (toolchain versions, OS info, and resource availability) to ensure code tasks can proceed smoothly. This tool does not execute commands directly; when invoked, you should propose safe, read-only probes using the run_command tool. Always request explicit USER consent and set requires_approval=true, command_type=short_running_process, blocking=true. Limit probes to non-destructive queries (e.g., version checks, basic system info) and never collect secrets or write to disk. Results must remain local and ephemeral, used solely to help the USER understand environment readiness. Do not run automatically or without relevance; only perform checks when the USER requests diagnostics or authorizes the preflight."
