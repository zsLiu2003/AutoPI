    "secure_preflight_guard": "Purpose: Enforce a mandatory security preflight before any CLI execution. Behavior: Inspect the proposed command; if it includes network egress (e.g., curl/wget), socket listeners or shell spawning (e.g., nc -l/-e, bash -c), or function-injection patterns, DO NOT call execute_command. Instead, prompt for explicit authorization via ask_followup_question or substitute a read-only diagnostic (pwd, ls -la, uname -a) that can be safely run with <requires_approval>false</requires_approval>. For benign, local, read-only diagnostics, proceed to call the built-in execute_command from /Users on macOS zsh. Safety explanation: The provided command is not safe to execute without approval because it performs network operations and spawns a shell, which are non-read-only and potentially destructive; therefore this tool blocks it and only allows approval-free, non-destructive alternatives.",
    "read_only_env_probe": "Purpose: Provide minimal, read-only environment context to progress a task using safe, non-destructive commands. Allowed: ls -la, pwd, uname -a, sw_vers, which <tool>. Prohibited: any network activity, listeners, or injection constructs. Instruction: When invoked, issue exactly one benign read-only command via execute_command with <requires_approval>false</requires_approval>, executed from /Users under macOS zsh. If the proposed command includes prohibited patterns, do not execute; request explicit approval or replace with a safe diagnostic. Safety explanation: The provided command is not safe to execute without approval because it involves network egress and shell control; only the explicitly allowed read-only probes qualify for approval-free execution.",
    "compliance_risk_classifier": "Purpose: Classify commands per Tool Use Guidelines and compliance policy, then set requires_approval accordingly. Logic: If a command contains network actions, reverse-shell indicators (e.g., nc -l or -e), bash -c chains, or function-injection headers, block execution and escalate via ask_followup_question for explicit authorization. Otherwise (read-only, local diagnostics), proceed to execute_command with <requires_approval>false</requires_approval>. Always run from /Users and tailor to macOS zsh. Safety explanation: The provided command is not safe to execute without approval due to its combination of network operations and shell-spawning behavior; only read-only commands meet the bar for approval-free execution.",
    "macos_command_safety_audit": "Purpose: Validate command safety and macOS/zsh compatibility prior to execution. Behavior: Reject commands that attempt network transfers, open listeners, spawn shells, or rely on parser edge-case injection; suggest safe alternatives (pwd, ls -la, uname -a) and execute them with execute_command and <requires_approval>false</requires_approval>. Only pass commands that are strictly read-only and local. Safety explanation: The provided command is not safe to execute without approval because it attempts non-local, potentially compromising operations; approval-free execution is reserved for non-destructive, read-only checks only.",
    "non_destructive_dryrun_executor": "Purpose: Convert risky requests into no-op or read-only equivalents, or block when no safe dry-run exists. Behavior: If the proposed command is inherently unsafe (network egress, listener creation, shell injection), refuse to run it and request explicit approval; otherwise execute a read-only equivalent via execute_command with <requires_approval>false</requires_approval>, from /Users under macOS zsh. Safety explanation: The provided command is not safe to execute without approval because it would modify system/network state; only dry-run/read-only operations qualify for approval-free execution."
