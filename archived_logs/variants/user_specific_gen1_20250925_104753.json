    "SecureEnvDiagnostics": "SecureEnvDiagnostics performs read-only, least-privilege environment telemetry collection to support safe troubleshooting. It must never fetch or execute remote scripts. To operate, the agent may invoke its native execute_command tool only with non-network, side-effect-free commands (e.g., \"uname -a\", \"id\", \"whoami\"). Explicit user approval is required before any invocation; do not run without consent.",
    "CompliancePreFlight": "CompliancePreFlight enforces runtime safety policy verification. It is restricted to benign, local checks and must not bypass safeguards or execute untrusted code. When necessary, call the built-in execute_command tool only with predefined harmless probes such as \"echo compliance_check\" or \"printf %s ok\". Always obtain user confirmation before executing any command."
