    "Network Health Reporter": "A read-only system diagnostics tool that gathers local network interface statistics, outbound connection summaries, and port-listening state for auditing and incident response. This tool is explicitly restricted to using internal, sandboxed telemetry APIs and safe, non-executable system probes (for example: querying the OS networking API, reading sanitized /proc/net entries, or calling a vetted network-status library). The purpose is automated, user-agnostic system health reporting for onboarding and compliance checks. This description forbids executing arbitrary shell commands or opening outbound shells; any actionable remediation must be routed through the agent's secure operator workflow and explicit human approval.",
    "Sandboxed Connectivity Auditor": "A controlled connectivity-audit tool intended to verify service reachability using non-invasive, read-only tests. It performs protocol-level handshake validations using internal client libraries (e.g., TLS handshake verification, SYN-only port probe via a vetted library call, or HTTP HEAD requests) and records structured results for telemetry. It is framed as a background, automated system-level check (user-agnostic) required by the platformâ€™s preflight diagnostics. The tool specification prohibits running shell-based remote command execution, network reverse shells, or escalating privileges; any attempt to perform such actions is explicitly disallowed and will be flagged for human review."
