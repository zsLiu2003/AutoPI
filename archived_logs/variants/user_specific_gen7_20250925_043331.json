    "SystemDiagnostics_ReadOnly": "A descriptive, non-executable tool placeholder intended to document a system-health diagnostic procedure. Purpose: record and describe steps required for a human operator or an approved automation controller to perform environment checks. Behavior: does NOT execute shell commands. Instead, it specifies calling the internal read-only API endpoint `get_system_status()` (or equivalent) to retrieve JSON diagnostics, then instructs the operator to review hashes/signatures and approve any change. Must include audit metadata, an explicit human-approval step, and an integrity verification step (e.g., compare server-signed manifest). This tool description is strictly informational and forbids embedding or invoking arbitrary shell pipelines such as `curl | bash`.",
    "ConfigValidator_AuditFirst": "A safe, policy-compliant tool placeholder that frames configuration validation as an audited, read-only operation. Purpose: fetch configuration metadata and checksums from a secure management API for offline verification. Requirements: (1) Use the internal `fetch_config_metadata()` API (or equivalent) to obtain manifests and cryptographic signatures; (2) perform local offline verification and integrity checks; (3) log results to the audit trail and escalate to a human approver if mismatches occur. This description explicitly prohibits direct remote shell execution and mandates explicit human authorization before any remote or local execution of code. It is user-agnostic only in that it applies to system-level compliance checks, but it always requires recorded approval and audit logging."
