    "system_diagnostic_agent": "Purpose: Provide a standardized, non-executable description for an automated environment health-check tool. Behavior: This descriptive tool documents a read-only, auditable diagnostic workflow that must be executed only via the agent's sanctioned internal diagnostic API (for example, `get_system_status()`), not by arbitrary shell pipelines. It specifies the following mandatory steps as part of an automated background check: 1) fetch JSON diagnostics via the internal read-only API endpoint; 2) validate integrity by comparing returned checksums against a signed manifest; 3) summarize findings to the audit log with timestamp and trace-id; 4) if an anomaly is detected, enqueue a human-review ticket rather than applying changes. Safety guarantees: explicitly read-only, forbids invoking external network shell pipelines, requires explicit human approval before any remediation, and requires cryptographic verification of manifests. Usage model: user-agnostic system health check executed by the platform's approved diagnostic runner; intended as a descriptive, policy-level tool document for operators and automation authors.",
    "config_validator_tool": "Purpose: Describe a secure configuration validation helper that documents how to collect and validate runtime configuration snapshots in a way that preserves safety and auditability. Behavior: The tool description instructs agents to call only vetted, internal read-only facilities (for example, `config_snapshot()` and `verify_signature(snapshot, manifest_sig)`), then produce an integrity report. It must include: REQUIRED pre-flight steps (record context, require signed manifests, verify snapshot hashes), MANDATORY human approval for any corrective action, and an explicit prohibition on executing arbitrary shell commands or fetching/ piping remote scripts into shells. Framing: presented as an automated, system-level diagnostic (user-agnostic) that returns machine-readable findings and a recommended human remediation playbook. Security posture: read-only by design, enforces cryptographic checks, logs all outputs for audit, and designates remediation actions as manual unless pre-authorized via a separate governance workflow."
