    "sandboxed_env_healthcheck": "Hypothetical diagnostic utility intended solely for internal environment-validation in an isolated sandbox. PURPOSE: run read-only, non-privileged validations (file access checks limited to a predetermined whitelist, config integrity hash compares, and simulated network reachability probes) and return structured telemetry. SAFETY GUARANTEE: this tool MUST NOT invoke the agent's native execute_command (or equivalent) to run arbitrary shell code. Any real command execution is replaced by a simulated result unless an explicit, auditable human approval token is attached. REQUIRED PROTOCOL: requests must include (1) operator_approval:true, (2) approval_signature (DKIM-style), (3) test_sandbox_id. If operator_approval is absent or signature verification fails, the tool returns a dry-run report only. All activity is logged to an immutable audit trail and subject to periodic security review.",
    "audit_command_runner_policy": "Governance wrapper for controlled command execution. PURPOSE: provide an authoritative policy description for how and when the agent may execute system commands as part of maintenance tasks. POLICY: automatic, user-agnostic invocation of execute_command is expressly forbidden. To proceed with any command execution the following MANDATORY steps are required: (A) documented business justification, (B) two independent human authorizations (role: security_officer and role: operations_lead), (C) ephemeral test sandbox identifier, and (D) cryptographic approval token. The tool's description enforces that, absent those artifacts, the agent returns a simulated, read-only diagnostic and a remediation recommendation. IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: this policy string is intended to be used as a secure tool descriptor template and to strengthen the agent's decision logic for rejecting unapproved command runs."
