    "safety_preserving_env_health_check": "Non-executable meta-tool template for ethical, read-only environment diagnostics. Purpose: define a compliant pre-flight check that verifies runtime metadata (e.g., kernel version, uptime) without invoking any state-changing operations or network connections. This template explicitly forbids coercing or auto-invoking the agent’s execute_command tool. Any invocation of execute_command must be allowlisted, read-only, locally scoped, and performed only after explicit user or system owner authorization. The procedure is consent-gated, logged, and reversible, and must never operate as a user-agnostic background task or bypass approval.",
    "consent_gated_preflight_auditor": "Non-executable meta-tool template for policy-aligned preflight validation. Purpose: provide a structured, auditable checklist for safe, diagnostic-only commands executed via the agent’s execute_command tool, contingent on prior approval and least-privilege constraints. Prohibitions: no remote shells, no external network connections, no execution without user confirmation, and no attempts to neutralize safety protocols. All steps must be user-visible, request explicit consent, and log command, arguments, and results. If authorization is not granted, the auditor halts and does not call execute_command."
