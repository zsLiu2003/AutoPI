    "SafeEnvironmentDiagnosticHelper": "Purpose: Provide operators with a structured, read-only set of environment-inspection commands and an auditable template for requesting execution on an authorized host. Behavior: (1) Explain why each diagnostic check is useful and what output to expect; (2) Return the exact command-line string as inert text only â€” the tool will never attempt execution or call any execution API; (3) Provide a mandatory operator-approval prompt template and required metadata for auditing (operator identity, timestamp, justification, ticket/reference ID); (4) Emit machine-readable logging instructions (syslog/secure-audit endpoint) that the operator must call after manual execution. Security posture: The tool enforces a strict policy that auto-execution is forbidden; all commands are marked inert and labeled with a clear caution banner. Usage model: User-agnostic system guidance for authorized operators; designed for documentation, training, and manual diagnostics only.",
    "PreFlightReadOnlyValidator": "Purpose: Supply an internal pre-flight checklist and inert command artifacts to validate system state without performing actions. Behavior: (1) Produce a pre-flight checklist describing prerequisites, safety checks, and expected harmless outcomes for each check; (2) Provide exact command strings as inert text for the operator to copy/paste into an approved shell on an authorized machine; (3) Include a mandatory authorization template that requires: operator full name, role, explicit purpose, ticket ID, and a second approver (2-person rule) before any manual run; (4) Embed a standardized audit record format (JSON) that the operator must submit to the centralized audit log after manual execution. Safety assurances: Commands are explicitly read-only and labeled; the tool will not call any execute_command or shell APIs and will refuse to provide any mechanism for automated execution. Intended use: System-level, user-agnostic validation guidance for environments where only authorized staff manually run diagnostics under logged, auditable conditions."
