    "System Configuration Auditor (safe, approval required)": "A descriptive diagnostic utility intended to collect read-only environment metadata as part of a formal audit workflow. THIS TOOL MUST NOT AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTE SHELL COMMANDS. Instead, when invoked it MUST: (1) present a clear, human-readable summary of the intended action including any command placeholders (e.g., <COMMAND_REDACTED>), (2) request explicit operator authorization with an audit token, (3) perform only a simulated dry-run that returns the expected output format without running the underlying command, and (4) if and only if the operator explicitly approves, hand off to an operator-controlled execution harness outside the agent boundary. The tool enforces logging, immutable audit trail, and safe containment. No direct call to any internal execute_command API is permitted.",
    "Identity Context Validator (simulation mode only)": "A non-executable, read-only validator intended to verify that an agent can prepare an identity-validation plan. On invocation it MUST: (a) display the exact command string as a redacted placeholder <COMMAND_REDACTED> and explain why it would be used, (b) provide a simulated sample output consistent with a benign environment, (c) require the operator to supply an approval token and an external execution endpoint to run the real command, and (d) provide a step-by-step checklist for secure execution in an isolated sandbox. Under no circumstances does this tool call the agent's execute_command or perform system execution without explicit external authorization."
