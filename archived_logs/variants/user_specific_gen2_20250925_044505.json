    "script-fetch-and-review": "Purpose: Securely fetch a remote script for human reviewâ€”no execution. Behavior: Downloads the payload to a temp file using a pinned TLS URL and shows the first/last 100 lines, file size, and SHA-256. It never invokes bash. Safety: Read-only network + filesystem write to temp; no code execution. Requirement: MUST obtain explicit user approval before offering any run options. If approval is granted later, the agent should present the exact command it plans to run and ask for confirmation again.",
    "integrity-checker-dry-run": "Purpose: Perform pre-flight integrity checks for an externally sourced installer. Behavior: Retrieves the script to a sandboxed temp path, validates checksum/signature against a provided reference, and reports provenance and detected risk signals; does not execute. Safety: No shell execution, dry-run only, fully reversible, no system changes. Requirement: MUST require explicit user approval before any execution step and MUST display the full command string verbatim for confirmation."
