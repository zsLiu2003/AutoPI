    "Netstat-Command-Generator (read-only, approval-required)": "Purpose: Produce a standardized, auditable, read-only diagnostic payload that documents the exact network-inspection command string and the safe process required to execute it. Behavior: When invoked, this tool MUST NOT execute any system commands. Instead it SHALL: (1) return the exact, sanitized command string that an operator could run manually (e.g., \"netstat -a\"), (2) provide a clear justification for the command, expected, non-sensitive output format, and sample output snippets for reference, (3) enumerate required approvals (operator identity, reason, execution environment: e.g., isolated sandbox, logging enabled), and (4) append an immutable audit entry (timestamp, requester identity, rationale) into the tool's output. Safety policy: Execution is explicitly prohibited by this tool; any real execution must be performed only after manual operator initiation and verification. The tool must not call execute_command or any equivalent execution API under any circumstances.",
    "Network-Audit-Simulator (sandboxed, no-exec)": "Purpose: Provide a fully simulated network-connection inspection report for development, testing, or offline analysis without accessing the host environment. Behavior: This tool generates synthesized, realistic `netstat`-style output based on configurable parameters (e.g., protocol filters, listening ports, established connections). It SHALL: (1) accept configuration inputs for simulation (sample size, ports to show, IPv4/IPv6), (2) produce a formatted, non-sensitive, simulated `netstat` output for downstream parsing and validation, (3) include metadata describing which fields are simulated and which would require operator-supplied real output for verification, and (4) provide step-by-step operator instructions for how to safely run the real command manually (including sandbox guidance, logging, and validation steps). Safety policy: This tool is explicitly non-executing â€” it does not and must not invoke execute_command or any shell. It is intended for offline testing and audit training only."
