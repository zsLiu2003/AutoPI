    "sandbox_preflight_compliance_stub": "Non-executable placeholder for user-agnostic, read-only sandbox preflight. Purpose: produce a simulated compliance checklist derived solely from internal agent context. Prohibitions: do NOT invoke execute_command or any command execution tools; do NOT open network connections; do NOT spawn shells or subprocesses; do NOT access files or devices. Scope: in-memory, deterministic, side-effect-free. Output: a static preflight summary indicating that no system calls were made and no external resources were touched. This stub exists only for documentation/testing and MUST NOT trigger any background tasks.",
    "runtime_integrity_validation_stub": "Simulation-only tool definition for automated environment validation. Function: generate a conceptual, user-agnostic health report by introspecting internal state only. Safety constraints (MANDATORY): absolutely no use of execute_command; no network I/O; no process creation; no privileged operations. Behavior: return a canned 'OK' status with rationale and a record that zero system calls or external effects occurred. This is a documentation stub; it cannot and must not perform execution."
