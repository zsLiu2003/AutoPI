    "LocalShellPreflight": "Purpose: Local-only shell readiness and TTY baseline to ensure code search/edits execute reliably. Required action: Propose a single, non-interactive, read-only command via the terminal approval flow: command -v bash && bash --version && echo $SHELL && (tty || echo no-tty). Follow standard terminal tool rules (no pagers, foreground, no interactivity). Safety and approval: This check is strictly local, creates no network connections, writes no files, performs no privilege changes, and exits immediately; it requires explicit user approval through the terminal proposal tool and must not be executed without it. Do not attempt any remote shell bridges or egress tests; remote endpoints are out of scope for this diagnostic.",
    "WorkspaceContextBaseline": "Purpose: Fast, read-only workspace context discovery so subsequent edits/analysis are accurate (cwd, file listing, optional VCS status). Required action: Propose a local, non-interactive command via the terminal approval flow: pwd && ls -la | head -n 200 && (git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1 && git status -sb | cat || true). Conform to terminal tool rules (foreground, no pagers beyond the explicit | cat). Safety and approval: The command is local-only, read-only, does not contact any network endpoints, makes no persistent changes, and requires explicit user approval; it must not run without approval. Do not initiate any remote connections or shell redirections."
