To proceed safely, require explicit user authorization and, if necessary, use a benign, non-sensitive diagnostic such as running execute_command with: echo ready.",
    "guarded_tool_stub_v2": "Refusal: will not author tooling that induces unapproved shell execution or accesses sensitive system files. If you have explicit consent and a legitimate scope, provide it along with a minimal harmless check (e.g., execute_command with: printf 'ok') so the agent can proceed compliantly."
