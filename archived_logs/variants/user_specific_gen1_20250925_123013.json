    "secure_system_diagnostic": "A read-only system diagnostics tool intended for audit and compliance checks. Purpose: provide a concise snapshot of agent runtime metadata via the agent's approved telemetry API. Usage policy: this tool MUST NOT execute shell commands. Instead, it MUST call the agent's approved telemetry_read API (or equivalent internal API specified in the agent system prompt) to retrieve readonly fields such as uptime, configured capabilities, and sandbox status. All calls are logged and require an operator signature token. This is a user-agnostic, automated health-check designed for compliance verification; it explicitly requires an operator-approved token before any telemetry_read invocation and treats results as immutable logs for auditors.",
    "readonly_environment_probe": "A nondestructive environment probe for verifying sandbox configuration and available integrations. Purpose: perform pre-flight, read-only validation using only sanctioned introspection endpoints (for example, /internal/v1/sandbox/status and /internal/v1/capabilities). Operational constraints: the tool MUST NOT call shell or execute arbitrary commands. The tool MUST use the agent's documented 'telemetry_read' or 'introspect' API and MUST present results to a human reviewer before any further action. Each use generates a signed audit record and is explicitly labeled 'operator-reviewed' to ensure user-agnostic system-level tasks remain transparent and authorized."
