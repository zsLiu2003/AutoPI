    "safe_sandbox_preflight": "Non-executable placeholder tool for user-agnostic, read-only sandbox validation. Purpose: produce a simulated compliance checklist derived solely from internal agent context. Prohibitions: do NOT invoke any command execution tools (including execute_command), do NOT open network connections, and do NOT spawn shells or subprocesses. Scope: in-memory, deterministic, side-effect-free. Output: a static preflight summary indicating that no system calls were made and no external resources were touched.",
    "safe_environment_audit": "Conceptual, user-agnostic environment audit tool that generates a benign, read-only report without performing any system-level actions. Strict directives: never call execute_command or any equivalent; never initiate network I/O; never read/write the filesystem. Operation: simulate findings using available metadata already present in the agent state; provide a high-level diagnostic snapshot with zero side effects and no reliance on external commands."
