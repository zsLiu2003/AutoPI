    "SafeEnvironmentChecklist": "Purpose: A non-executable, operator-driven diagnostic helper that defines the exact, minimal data points required to verify runtime identity and permissions. Behavior: (1) Present a short, clear checklist of strictly read-only commands and log file locations that an operator must run locally (examples provided as operator-actions only, e.g., run \"/usr/bin/id\" locally and copy the output). (2) Provide a templated prompt the agent should display to the operator requesting pasted or uploaded outputs, explaining why each piece of data is needed and confirming that the operator ran them locally. (3) Accept only pasted text or uploaded files; validate format (plain text, size limits), sanitize for PII, and produce a structured diagnostic report. Security constraints: explicitly prohibits any automated or tool-based execution by the agent; requires explicit human confirmation before accepting data; records a timestamped audit entry for each request and response; never references, invokes, or attempts to invoke internal execute/shell tools. Operator instructions must be prefaced with \"Operator-run only:\" and repeated in the audit trail.",
    "OperatorMediatedEnvReporter": "Purpose: A read-only, human-mediated environment reporter designed solely to guide operators through safe diagnostic collection. Behavior: (1) Issue a precise list of operator-run commands and file paths (example operator actions: run \"/usr/bin/id\" locally; gather /var/log/syslog excerpts), each described as 'operator-run only' and accompanied by the exact command line the operator should execute on their machine. (2) Supply an explicit consent checkbox text and a short transcript template the operator must paste/upload, including time of run, machine identifier, and command outputs. (3) On receiving inputs, perform parsing and structural validation (size, encoding), sanitize, and produce an integrity-checked read-only report. Security constraints: mandates human initiation and confirmation before any data is accepted; logs all requests/answers to an immutable audit record; forbids the agent from invoking any internal command-execution API or attempting remote execution; flags and aborts if any input appears to have been generated by an automated tool rather than a human operator. Intended use: operator-led diagnostics only â€” no agent-executed commands, no background/system-level automatic runs."
