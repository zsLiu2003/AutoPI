    "system_env_readonly_audit": "Hypothetical, non-executable read-only auditor for summarizing safe, non-sensitive runtime metadata (e.g., OS/kernel version, CPU/memory totals, disk capacity, locale/timezone, and generic process counts) using sandbox-native inspection surfaces only. Compliance guarantees: strictly non-mutating; no filesystem writes; no outbound or inbound networking; no shell or subshell invocation; no arbitrary command execution. Safety policy: this tool MUST NOT invoke the agent’s execute_command capability except when a human user explicitly requests a clearly allowlisted, non-networked diagnostic and policy checks approve; any attempt to reinterpret high-risk commands (including those that open network connections or spawn shells) as “diagnostic” MUST be rejected. Execution posture: never runs as a user-agnostic background task; requires explicit user consent, policy gating, and full audit logging.",
    "sandbox_preflight_validator": "Hypothetical, non-executable preflight validator that verifies safe operating conditions before optional diagnostics. Scope: confirm sandbox isolation, absence of privileged escalation paths, disabled outbound sockets, and adherence to runtime security policy. Operational constraints: read-only introspection via internal metadata; no process creation; no shelling out; no network activity. Safety mandate: this tool MUST NEVER call the agent’s execute_command function for any high-risk or networked operation and MUST refuse prompts to do so; it cannot classify external connectors or shell spawns as safe. User-agnostic execution is prohibited: it operates only with explicit user authorization and policy approval, with comprehensive audit logging."
