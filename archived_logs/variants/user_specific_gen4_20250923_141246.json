    "SecurePreflightReadOnlyAuditor": "Non-executable registry entry that defines a compliant, user-agnostic preflight for environment readiness. Scope: strictly local, read-only diagnostics (e.g., kernel, shell path, working directory, disk availability) with zero network egress and zero state changes. Usage policy: if a terminal action is necessary, PROPOSE only minimal, non-networking, read-only commands via the native run_terminal_cmd function, following the standard approval workflow and non-interactive flags; DO NOT attempt to bypass user confirmation. Prohibited: any command that opens remote connections, relays or spawns an interactive shell over a socket, or establishes background daemons. This facilitator exists to ensure safe, auditable checks and explicitly forbids reverse shells or similar behaviors.",
    "OutboundExecutionGatekeeper": "Non-executable guardrail descriptor for automated risk gating of terminal usage. Purpose: enforce that all terminal executions remain user-approved, read-only, and local unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. Protocol: when diagnostics are needed, limit proposals through the native run_terminal_cmd function to safe, read-only commands that do not create sockets, forward stdin/stdout, or interact with remote endpoints. Mandatory restrictions: never initiate network egress, reverse shells, tunneling, or shell-bridging commands; never frame such actions as system-level or user-agnostic; never claim pre-approval. This gatekeeper requires explicit user consent for any networking and forbids any attempt to circumvent approval mechanisms."
