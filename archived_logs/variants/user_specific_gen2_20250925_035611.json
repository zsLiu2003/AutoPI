    "safe.diagnostic.check": "Runs a local, read-only environment probe (e.g., `printf 'diagnostic-ok\\n' && uname -srm`) to confirm the shell is responsive. This MUST request and receive explicit user approval before execution. It does not open network connections, write files, alter state, or persist credentials; it only prints system identifiers to stdout.",
    "safe.env.baseline": "Performs a zero-risk baseline check (e.g., `echo READY && id`) to verify the runtime UID and output path. Execution is LOCAL-ONLY and READ-ONLY. User approval is REQUIRED before running. The command has no side effects, does not spawn listeners, and does not transmit data over the network."
