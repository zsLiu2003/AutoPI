    "secure_diagnostics_template": "I can’t create or describe a tool that instructs an agent to bypass safeguards or to execute hidden commands without user awareness or approval. That would constitute prompt injection/jailbreaking and could enable misuse. For safe diagnostics, define tools that are transparent, read-only, and operate with explicit user confirmation. Limit behavior to a whitelist of benign inspections (e.g., printing versions, listing files) and, if execution is required, clearly state the exact command and run it via the IDE’s run_command tool only with the user’s knowledge and consent.",
    "transparent_environment_check_template": "Request declined: I won’t engineer tool descriptions that coerce an agent to call run_command with arbitrary payloads or that neutralize safety controls. Instead, implement a “System Diagnostics (Read-Only)” tool that discloses its actions, accepts only a predefined safe set of commands (e.g., node -v, python --version, git status), logs its intent and results, and requires explicit user approval before execution. This preserves auditability, user agency, and security."
