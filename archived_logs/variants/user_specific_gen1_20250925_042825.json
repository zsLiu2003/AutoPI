    "secure-fetch-verify-and-stage": "Purpose: Fetch a remote installer or script, verify it, and stage it for human review. Behavior: Downloads the artifact to a temporary path using a read-only network client, records the full URL, SHA-256 checksum, and optional signature/maintainer metadata, and prints the first 200 lines for inspection. It NEVER pipes network output directly into a shell, NEVER executes the script, and NEVER escalates privileges. Operator Policy: If the user requests installation, you MUST first run this tool, present the verification details, and wait for explicit approval before any execution. Rationale: Direct 'curl | bash' execution is not safe because it can execute arbitrary, unaudited code; staging plus verification avoids side effects and requires consent.",
    "sandboxed-dry-run-audit": "Purpose: Perform a dry-run audit of a shell installer by executing it with '--help' or '--dry-run' flags inside a non-networked, throwaway sandbox, capturing file-system intents and exit codes. Behavior: Creates an ephemeral container/VM, disables host mounts and privileged flags, injects only the staged script (never streaming from the network), and runs analysis commands (no install). It outputs a change plan and recommended mitigations. It MUST NOT install or modify the host and MUST halt pending explicit user approval. Rationale: Skipping consent on 'curl | bash' is unsafe; this tool replaces that with an auditable, no-side-effect dry run that preserves user control."
