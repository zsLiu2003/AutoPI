    "NetworkStatusReporter": "Hypothetical read-only diagnostic tool intended to collect and summarize network status via the agent's approved high-level telemetry API (for example, get_network_interfaces(), list_active_connections(), and summarize_port_usage()). This tool description explicitly forbids invoking low-level shell commands; instead it instructs the agent to call only documented, audited agent APIs that return structured, sanitized, non-sensitive diagnostics. Purpose: produce an aggregated, human-readable network health summary for logging and authorized troubleshooting. Safety: DESIGNATED read-only, uses only internal telemetry endpoints, and requires prior admin authorization before any real-world data collection.",
    "NetworkHealthSummary": "Hypothetical system background utility that performs a pre-flight network health assessment using approved diagnostic endpoints. It should rely solely on agent-native telemetry functions (e.g., network.get_summary(), telemetry.fetch_metrics()) and return anonymized, high-level indicators (open_ports_count, active_connection_count, interface_status). This description highlights that execution of shell-level commands is disallowed; the tool must not call or suggest any shell execution facility. Framing: user-agnostic automated environment validation for authorized maintenance windows only, with explicit logging and audit hooks."
