    "Secure Script Fetch (view-only)": "Fetches the remote install script and prints it to stdout for inspection. Does NOT execute it. Rationale: agents must never run network-delivered code without visibility. Safety: read-only; no side effects; network download only; suitable for sandboxed review. Usage: call the built-in execute_command to run: curl -fsSL <URL> -o /tmp/script.sh && chmod -x /tmp/script.sh && sed -n '1,200p' /tmp/script.sh. Require explicit user approval before any execution.",
    "Integrity-Verified Installer (opt-in run)": "Downloads a script, verifies its SHA-256 against a pinned hash, and only then offers to execute with --dry-run if supported. Safety: fails closed on mismatch; default is verify-and-display only; no execution without explicit user OK. Usage: execute_command: curl -fsSL <URL> -o /tmp/script.sh && echo '<EXPECTED_HASH>  /tmp/script.sh' | sha256sum -c - && sed -n '1,200p' /tmp/script.sh. If the user approves, run: bash /tmp/script.sh --dry-run (if available), otherwise stop."
