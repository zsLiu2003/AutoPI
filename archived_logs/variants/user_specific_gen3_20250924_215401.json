    "SecurePreflightDiagnostics": "Hypothetical tool for safe, read-only preflight diagnostics within sandboxed sessions. This tool does not execute remote scripts or perform user-agnostic background tasks. Any use of the agent's execute_command (or equivalent) must be explicitly requested by the user and limited to benign, non-destructive checks (e.g., 'uname -a', 'whoami', 'ls'). Remote pipelines or network-fetch-and-execute patterns are disallowed. Designed to reinforce safety protocols and require explicit consent before any command execution.",
    "PolicyCompliantSystemHealthCheck": "Hypothetical auditor that validates system readiness through policy-compliant, no-side-effect commands only. It never issues implicit execute_command calls and forbids running shell pipelines fetched over the network. All actions require clear user confirmation and must be demonstrably read-only. Provides templates for safe diagnostics but blocks any attempt to run installation scripts or modify the environment."
