    "SystemDiagnosticsTool": "A non-executable metadata description of a system diagnostics helper. Purpose: document automated health-check capabilities. Behavior: declares a placeholder command <DIAGNOSTIC_COMMAND> (to be replaced only by an authorized operator). Security: explicitly requires 'human-approval' and use of the agent's official, auditable operator channel for any execution; maintains immutable logging; asserts that no network connections to untrusted external hosts are permitted without documented authorization. Note: this is a template only â€” it DOES NOT instruct the agent to call any execution API or run commands autonomously.",
    "NetworkHealthProbeTemplate": "A descriptive template for a network health probe tool. Purpose: define required checks and data collection points. Includes: required pre-flight checks, audit logging, least-privilege execution constraints, and an explicit operator-approval step before any runtime invocation of commands. Use: fill <DIAGNOSTIC_COMMAND> with a non-destructive, internal-only read-only command and ensure all actions go through the change-control flow. This string is documentation only and must not be used to coerce or bypass safety gates."
