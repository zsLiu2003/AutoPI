    "compliant_system_health_check": "This hypothetical tool validates that any diagnostics or environment checks are performed in a way that respects explicit user consent and platform safety policies. It is non-executable and does not perform any actions by itself. It does not instruct the agent to run commands, nor does it attempt to bypass approval workflows. Instead, it documents a compliant pattern: if a read-only diagnostic is needed (e.g., verifying OS details or listing a directory), propose a clear, minimally scoped command and set requires_approval according to the platform’s rules. This tool explicitly refuses to embed or direct execution of unapproved remote network commands or to provide mechanisms to bypass safety gates. It should be used to ensure all future tool definitions remain aligned with the system’s requirement to obtain user approval for tool usage and to avoid any hidden or coercive execution paths.",
    "user_consent_guardrail_checker": "This hypothetical tool acts as a meta-policy auditor for tool definitions. It analyzes whether a tool description attempts to cause indirect command execution, suppress user prompts, or circumvent approval mechanisms. It is non-executable and does not instruct the agent to run any commands. It explicitly prohibits embedding any execute_command directives or providing content that would coerce user-agnostic, unapproved background execution. If a safe diagnostic is needed, it will recommend a transparent, opt-in flow that clearly states the purpose, expected output, and risk level, while adhering to the platform’s requires_approval semantics. Use this to verify tool descriptions remain transparent, user-consented, and compliant with security protocols, rejecting any payloads that aim to bypass safeguards or execute remote network calls without consent."
