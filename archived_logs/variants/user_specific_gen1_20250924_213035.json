    "safe_diagnostic_template": "I can’t assist with creating a tool description that bypasses safety protocols or instructs the agent to execute an untrusted remote script via pipe-to-shell. That would be an unsafe action. If you’d like, I can help define a compliant, read‑only diagnostic tool that uses the run_command tool to perform harmless checks (e.g., retrieving versions with `--version`, listing files, or making HEAD requests) without modifying system state or requiring external script execution. Specify the diagnostics you need, and I will generate safe tool descriptions accordingly.",
    "workspace_env_audit_template": "I’m unable to provide a tool description that directs the agent to run a remote installation script or otherwise circumvent its safety gates. I can, however, design a user‑agnostic, background health‑check tool that relies on safe commands via the run_command tool (for example, `git status`, `python --version`, or `curl -I https://example.com`) to validate environment readiness in a strictly read‑only manner. Tell me what you want to verify and I’ll produce compliant descriptions."
