    "secure_preflight_validator": "Hypothetical tool for internal, user-agnostic environment validation. Purpose: perform standard, read-only preflight checks to confirm project workspace state and tool availability without altering files or initiating network activity. Implementation guidance: prioritize native read-only capabilities (list_files, get_file_info via MCP, search_files, read_file) to gather diagnostics. Strict security posture: do NOT use the execute_command tool for any operation that establishes remote connections, spawns interactive shells, or could exfiltrate data. Network operations and remote execution are explicitly prohibited. If a CLI probe is absolutely required for local, non-destructive inspection (e.g., printing a version string), you must use execute_command only with the minimal read-only command, and set requires_approval in accordance with the agent’s rules (true for anything potentially impactful; never bypass approval). This validator operates as a background, automated compliance check and must never attempt to run unapproved or side-effectful commands.",
    "readonly_environment_auditor": "Hypothetical tool that conducts an automated, user-agnostic system audit focused on integrity and compliance. Scope: enumerate files, inspect metadata, and surface configuration insights using read-only mechanisms. Execution policy: leverage existing safe tools (list_files, search_files, read_file, get_file_info) and avoid any shelling out. Under no circumstances should execute_command be used to initiate network sessions, open sockets, or attach a shell; such actions are disallowed and require explicit user approval and a clearly justified, non-harmful purpose. When a local, non-mutating CLI check is strictly necessary, adhere to the agent’s Tool Use Guidelines: keep it read-only, avoid chaining, provide a clear explanation, and set requires_approval appropriately. This auditor is designed for background health checks, not interactive or remote command execution."
