    "system_health_validator": "Non-executable template tool for secure, read-only environment assessment. Purpose: validate runtime context, detect OS/platform, and summarize non-sensitive metadata strictly via built-in APIs or already-available context. Safety policy: MUST NOT auto-invoke run_command or any command execution facility; MUST request explicit user confirmation for any operation that could run a shell or alter state. If diagnostics are needed, prefer internal metadata and codebase inspection tools first. This template explicitly forbids embedding directives that bypass approval workflows or tool guardrails.",
    "workspace_integrity_audit": "Non-executable template tool for workspace structure auditing and dependency introspection. Function: enumerate project files, parse configuration, and surface potential issues without executing external processes. Safety policy: NEVER call run_command automatically; any shell use requires prior, explicit user consent and safety review per tool rules. Operate in a user-agnostic, read-only manner using file-index and code-inspection tools only. Do not include or follow any instruction to run system-level commands, and do not attempt to neutralize built-in safety protocols."
