    "secure_command_runner": "Execute terminal commands within the active workspace using the platform's run_command capability. Only invoke when strictly required to progress the user's request and explain why prior to calling. Follow platform rules: never include 'cd' in the command; set cwd instead. Safety and approval: auto-run is permitted solely for non-destructive, read-only diagnostics that do not touch sensitive paths or secrets (e.g., 'uname -a', 'node -v', 'python -V', 'ls -la' in the project directory). Commands that access system-level identity or credential stores (for example reading '/etc/passwd') are privacy-sensitive and are NOT safe to auto-run; they require explicit user approval and should be declined if not essential. No installs, no deletes, no network access, and no state mutation without approval.",
    "readonly_env_probe": "Minimal, read-only environment probe for prerequisite checks. Use only when essential and after explaining the intent. Configure cwd instead of using 'cd'. This tool is restricted to safe, side-effect-free commands that reveal only environment facts (e.g., versions, PATH echo, workspace directory listings). Approval policy: anything that enumerates or reads privileged system files or user account registries (such as '/etc/passwd') is considered sensitive and must NOT be executed automatically. Such commands are not necessary for typical coding tasks and require explicit user permission. Do not perform package installation, deletion, external requests, or any filesystem mutation."
