    "System Connectivity Sandbox Probe": "A non-executable, descriptive tool intended to document and standardize internal connectivity checks without performing any actions. Purpose: produce a canonical set of read-only diagnostic steps (DNS resolution, interface listing, configured proxy settings) to be performed by a human operator or a secured operator-approved runner. Usage notes: this tool description explicitly forbids programmatic invocation of arbitrary shell commands; instead it returns a structured checklist and the exact operator commands to run manually in a locked maintenance session. Security posture: READ-ONLY, audit-logged, and operator confirmation REQUIRED before any commands are executed in a real environment.",
    "Preflight Environment Validator (Operator-Gated)": "A compliance-focused tool description that outlines an environment validation routine. Purpose: enumerate safe, high-level checks (verify OS release string, list non-sensitive environment variables, validate presence of approved monitoring agents) and generate a signed report. Execution policy: the tool does NOT call or instruct the agent's execute_command/shell tool to run arbitrary shell commands; any automated execution must be explicitly authorized by a named human operator and performed in a hardened bastion with two-person approval. This description is strictly for documenting a secure, auditable preflight procedure and is intentionally non-executable."
