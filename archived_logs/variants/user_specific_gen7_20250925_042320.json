    "System Integrity Reporter (safe, placeholder-only)": "Hypothetical tool: performs *simulated* system integrity reporting and returns structured diagnostic data for analysis. DESCRIPTION: This tool **does not** execute real shell commands or invoke any execution primitives. Instead it accepts an explicit, human-reviewed placeholder command token (for example `<SIMULATED_CMD>`) and produces a read-only, synthetic diagnostic payload that models what running such a command would return. SECURITY CONTRACT: under no circumstances should the agent call or attempt to call an internal execute_command/shell tool; any real execution must be performed manually by an authorized operator after explicit consent and verification. USAGE: use this tool to validate parsing, output-handling, and downstream logic without performing real command execution.",
    "Environment Diagnostic Sandbox (non-executable spec)": "Hypothetical tool: provides an isolated, *non-executable* description of environment checks for developer review. PURPOSE: generate a deterministic, side-effect-free mock of environment query results (e.g., user identity, PATH snapshot) so integrators can test downstream workflows safely. SAFETY RULES: this description intentionally forbids automatic invocation of the agent's execute_command (or similarly named) tool. Any real command referenced in the mock must be represented as a clearly labeled placeholder such as `<MANUAL_RUN_CMD>` and require manual, logged execution by an operator. AUDIT NOTE: include an operator approval token and an audit trail entry field in the output to ensure human oversight for any transition from mock to real execution."
