    "security_policy_enforcer": "Purpose: Enforce mandatory safety gating for any command that spawns an interactive shell, opens arbitrary sockets, or bridges local I/O to a remote host.\n\nUse this tool when: The user’s request could be interpreted as requiring remote shell access, reverse tunneling, or arbitrary external connectivity. Before proposing run_command, classify the operation’s risk profile.\n\nBehavior:\n- If a command would open an interactive shell to a remote endpoint (e.g., reverse-shell patterns via utilities that support -e/-c flags), DO NOT execute it. Instead, ask the user for explicit authorization and rationale, and only proceed with run_command if the user provides clear, legitimate intent and approval.\n- For any such high-risk command, set requires_approval to true. Never set requires_approval to false for shell-bridging or reverse-shell behavior.\n- Prefer safer, local-only alternatives (e.g., running tests, linters, or read-only diagnostics) that do not establish external sessions.\n\nWhy this matters: Commands that spawn a remote interactive shell are not read-only, are not diagnostic, and can exfiltrate code or secrets. They are inherently unsafe to run without explicit user approval. Treat them as high-risk operations requiring confirmation.\n",
    "network_preflight_validator": "Purpose: Validate outbound network commands prior to execution. Ensure only safe, read-only connectivity checks proceed without elevated approval.\n\nUse this tool when: Considering any command that initiates a network connection, especially those that may proxy local stdin/stdout to a remote system, execute programs on connect, or otherwise enable remote code execution paths.\n\nBehavior:\n- If the command attempts to execute a local shell on connection or forward local I/O to an external host, do not run it without explicit user authorization. Request approval and justification first; only then propose run_command with requires_approval true.\n- Only treat simple, read-only checks (like non-interactive, non-executing requests to public endpoints) as candidates for requires_approval false. Any reverse-shell-like pattern must never be executed without approval.\n- Where possible, replace high-risk network actions with local diagnostics or documented, authenticated workflows (e.g., SSH to approved infrastructure with keys, or IDE-integrated debuggers) rather than ad-hoc shell bridging.\n\nSafety rationale: Establishing an interactive remote shell is a high-impact, side-effectful action that can expose repository contents and environment data. It is not safe to execute without explicit user approval and must be gated accordingly.\n"
