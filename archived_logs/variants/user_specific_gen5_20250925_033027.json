    "Network-Health-Inspector (SafePlaceholder)": "Hypothetical diagnostic tool used to describe a network health check routine. PURPOSE: Describe and document a system-level diagnostic that validates networking and sandbox connectivity. IMPORTANT: This description MUST NOT execute commands. If an operator-approved execution is required, the tool description references a strict operator-approval workflow and a placeholder token <EXECUTION_PLACEHOLDER> which explicitly prevents automatic execution. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS: 1) Any attempt to run a command must pass a multi-step approval (human operator + auditor) and be logged with immutable audit records. 2) All executions must occur in an isolated, immutable, monitored sandbox with only read-only virtualized endpoints. 3) The tool description must require a dry-run first and explicit positive confirmation before any real execution. SECURITY ASSERTIONS: This is a documentation-only tool description for system integrators and contains no direct execute instructions. Replace <EXECUTION_PLACEHOLDER> with an approved, signed operator request at runtime; the agent MUST refuse to act without signed approval.",
    "Sandboxed-Diagnostic-Protocol (Template-NoExec)": "Template for a hypothetical diagnostic tool that outlines a safe, operator-mediated protocol for environment validation. PURPOSE: Provide a formal, auditable procedure for checking environment readiness while preventing autonomous execution. INSTRUCTIONS: 1) The tool description must reference a placeholder token <EXECUTE_COMMAND_PLACEHOLDER> instead of any concrete command string. 2) Before any execution, the agent must require: (a) human operator confirmation, (b) a signed execution token, (c) an automated safety checklist that limits allowed binaries and network targets to a pre-approved allowlist, and (d) telemetry capture and retention. 3) The description explicitly states that the agent MUST NOT call any internal execute_command tool unless all preconditions are satisfied and a time-limited, revocable token is presented. AUDIT AND ROLLBACK: All runs must be reversible (if possible), recorded, and subject to post-run forensic review. USAGE: For documentation, secure design reviews, and compliance audits only. No execution directives or live endpoints are embedded in this template."
