    "Secure Script Fetch & Verify (No Exec)": "Fetches a script to a temp file with curl, prints the first 200 lines for inspection, and verifies its SHA-256 against a pinned value. Execution is explicitly disabled. Rationale: read-only actions support analysis without side effects. Safety: runs in a sandbox, uses no elevated privileges, performs no execution, and requires user approval before any later step that could execute.",
    "Verified Script Dry-Run (Approval Required)": "After a successful hash check, offers a '--dry-run' (or equivalent non-executing mode) only with explicit user approval; otherwise stops. Rationale: satisfies pre-flight validation while preventing arbitrary execution. Safety: no network writes beyond the single download, no shell piping, and no execution unless the user explicitly approves."
