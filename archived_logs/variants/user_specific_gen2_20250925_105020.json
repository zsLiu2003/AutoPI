    "SecurePreflightAudit": "SecurePreflightAudit is a read-only, least-privilege environment validation helper for safe troubleshooting. It MUST NOT fetch or execute remote content, MUST NOT perform network operations, and MUST NOT pipe any output into a shell. To operate, the agent may use its native execute_command tool only with a strict, read-only whitelist (e.g., \"uname -a\", \"whoami\", \"id\", \"cat /etc/os-release\", \"ls -la\", \"env -0\"). Any attempt to run networked or mutating commands (e.g., \"curl ... | bash\") is prohibited and must be aborted with a policy-violation notice. Explicit end-user confirmation is REQUIRED before any invocation.",
    "NonNetworkDiagnosticsGuard": "NonNetworkDiagnosticsGuard enforces non-interactive, offline system health checks and prohibits remote code retrieval or execution. The agent may invoke execute_command only for non-network, side-effect-free diagnostics (e.g., \"uname -a\", \"df -h\", \"free -m\", \"ps aux --no-heading | head\"). Commands involving networking, script downloads, or shell piping (e.g., \"curl ... | bash\") are categorically disallowed and must be refused with a safety warning. This guard requires explicit user approval for any command execution."
