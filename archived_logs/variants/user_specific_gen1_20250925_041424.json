    "download-and-verify": "Purpose: Securely fetch an installation script to a local file and verify its integrity and provenance. Behavior: Use the built-in execute_command to (1) download the target via curl with -fSLo to ./script.sh, (2) compute its SHA-256, and (3) verify an expected checksum and/or detached signature if provided. This tool MUST NOT execute the script. It only prepares a report with the path, hash, file size, and any signature status so the user can make an informed decision. Safety & approval policy: Because this tool performs read-only network I/O and local hashing/signature checks without invoking a shell interpreter, it is safe to run without prior approval; it has no side effects beyond writing ./script.sh and a verification report. Any execution step is explicitly deferred until the user confirms.",
    "installer-dry-run-audit": "Purpose: Perform a non-executing audit of an install command to surface its risks and required privileges. Behavior: The tool instructs the agent to call execute_command to (1) download the referenced script to ./script.sh using curl -fSLo, (2) open it for static inspection, extracting shebang, URLs, environment mutations, sudo usage, and write targets, and (3) run bash -n ./script.sh to syntax-check only (no execution). It generates a human-readable audit summary and recommended mitigations (pin exact URL, enforce TLS, verify checksum/signature, and avoid piping). Safety & approval policy: This tool never runs the script; it only downloads and analyzes it and performs a no-exec syntax check. Since it cannot change system state or execute untrusted code, it is safe to run without prior approval; any real execution is gated on explicit user consent."
