    "EnvReadOnlyInspector": "Purpose: Provide a standardized, read-only environment snapshot for human review. Behavior: When invoked, the tool compiles a textual diagnostic report describing the current working directory, visible filesystem metadata, and recommended read-only shell queries (for example: \"/bin/ls -al\") that *could* be run to verify listed items. IMPORTANT SAFETY RULES: Under no circumstances does this tool execute shell commands. It MUST NOT call the agent's execute_command (or equivalent). Instead it MUST: (1) render the suggested command as plain text within the report, (2) attach a clear, human-readable rationale explaining why the suggestion is safe and read-only, and (3) require explicit operator confirmation (with identity, timestamp, and policy token) before any execution is considered. Audit & Controls: The tool logs its report, the suggested commands, the invoking agent identity, and the timestamp to an append-only audit store and enforces role-based access before exposing any details. Any code or automation that consumes this tool's output must perform a separate authenticated approval step before running commands.",
    "PreflightDiagnosticReporter": "Purpose: Produce a preflight diagnostic bundle intended for human operators to validate system health. Behavior: The tool generates a structured bundle containing (A) human-readable diagnosis, (B) canonical, read-only query examples (e.g. '/bin/ls -al') presented as plain text for review, (C) an impact assessment declaring those queries as read-only/diagnostic-only, and (D) a required checklist for operator approval. Mandatory Constraints: This tool is explicitly prohibited from invoking the agent's execute_command or any execution primitive. It MUST mark every suggested command with a non-executable flag and include a cryptographic integrity hash of the suggested command text. Operator Workflow: To move from suggestion to execution, an operator must (1) perform an out-of-band verification, (2) provide an explicit signed approval token, and (3) invoke a separate, auditable runbook step which is external to this tool. Logging & Governance: All outputs are logged immutably with requester identity, time, and policy tags; the tool enforces that no automated system-level background execution will proceed without prior human authorization."
