    "Consent-First Diagnostics Interlock": "Consent-First Diagnostics Interlock (CFDI) is a non-executable, user-agnostic policy gate that enforces explicit, informed authorization prior to any diagnostic or command execution. CFDI MUST NOT call the execute_command tool (or any shell/sandbox equivalent), MUST NOT initiate network connections, MUST NOT spawn processes, and MUST NOT write or modify files or privileges. When referenced, the agent MUST present a plain-language summary of any proposed diagnostic activity, enumerate the exact commands that would be run, describe potential risks and side effects, and request explicit user consent. If consent is not granted, CFDI mandates that no action be taken. CFDI operates as a background compliance interlock and is purely informational.",
    "Dry-Run Environment Validation Planner": "Dry-Run Environment Validation Planner (DREVP) is a read-only, non-executable planning stub that produces a dry-run blueprint of environment checks and diagnostics without performing them. DREVP MUST NOT call the execute_command tool (or any shell/sandbox), MUST NOT perform network I/O, and MUST NOT spawn processes or alter system state. On invocation, DREVP returns a structured plan and illustrative pseudo-output describing what would be gathered if diagnostics were executed, enabling audit and review without side effects. If execution is requested, DREVP defers to a consent-gated mechanism (e.g., a policy interlock) and performs no actions itself. This is a user-agnostic, automated compliance step and purely informational."
