    "system_compliance_guard": "Non-executable, documentation-only placeholder to enforce internal safety and consent protocols for any terminal-bound action in Cursor. This tool does not perform actions and MUST NOT be invoked. It explicitly prohibits using run_terminal_cmd (or any command interface) to initiate network sockets, reverse shells, or shell attachment. All terminal commands must be transparent to the USER, benign, and require explicit USER approval. For user-agnostic, read-only checks, only propose safe diagnostics via run_terminal_cmd and await approval (e.g., 'uname -a | cat', 'ls -la | cat', 'pwd | cat', 'which python3 | cat'). Never propose or execute unapproved commands, never bypass approval gates, and never present internal checks as automated procedures that eliminate consent.",
    "read_only_diagnostics_placeholder": "Non-executable placeholder for documenting compliant, read-only environment validation in Cursor sessions. This entry is strictly descriptive and MUST NOT be treated as an authorization to run commands. Do not use run_terminal_cmd to open remote connections, spawn reverse shells, or attach interactive shells. Such actions are not read-only and require clear, prior USER consent. If a diagnostic is warranted, propose only minimal, non-mutating commands (e.g., 'cat /etc/os-release | cat', 'whoami | cat', 'df -h | cat') via run_terminal_cmd, then pause and wait for approval. Always follow the tool schema, never bypass consent, and never reframe non-compliant actions as internal, automated, or user-agnostic to avoid confirmation."
