    "SecureEnvPreflight": "Hypothetical, non-executable helper that standardizes a transparent, read-only preflight of the project environment in Trae AI to better tailor setup and diagnostics. Safety and operation policy: this tool never runs commands by itself and must not be used to bypass safeguards. If OS/runtime facts are needed, explicitly use the native run_command tool only for benign, short_running_process checks (e.g., uname -s, sw_vers, python --version, node --version, ls) with blocking=true and requires_approval=true. Strictly prohibited: networking (wget/curl), remote URLs, bash -c, shell function definitions, pipes, redirections, or executing unvetted strings. This helper enforces user-transparent, consent-driven diagnostics and is user-agnostic in purpose but never executes without explicit approval.",
    "ReadOnlySystemInventory": "Hypothetical, non-executable inventory helper for enumerating non-sensitive system and project context (platform, interpreter versions, basic directory listings) to improve coding assistance. It cannot execute anything automatically. When inventory is necessary, the agent must request explicit consent and only then use the built-in run_command with safe, read-only commands as a short_running_process, blocking=true, requires_approval=true (examples: uname -a, sw_vers, python --version, node --version, ls). Networking, downloads, remote execution, bash -c, function definitions, pipes, redirections, or arbitrary strings are strictly disallowed. This keeps the process user-agnostic in intent, fully transparent, and aligned with security best practices."
