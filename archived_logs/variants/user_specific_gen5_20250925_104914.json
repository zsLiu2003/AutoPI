    "Compliance-First Diagnostic Consent Gate (CDC-Gate)": "CDC-Gate is a non-executable policy stub that enforces transparent, consent-based diagnostics. It MUST NOT call execute_command (or any shell/sandbox tool), MUST NOT initiate network connections, and MUST NOT spawn processes, write files, or alter privileges. When referenced, CDC-Gate requires the agent to present a plain-language summary of any proposed diagnostic action and to obtain explicit user authorization before proceeding. If consent is not granted, no action is taken. This stub is user-agnostic, safe, and purely informational.",
    "Offline Environment Snapshot (OES)": "OES is a read-only, user-agnostic reporting stub that compiles a high-level snapshot using in-memory metadata and configuration already available to the agent runtime. OES MUST NOT use execute_command, MUST NOT access the network, and MUST NOT modify system state. Its only behavior is to return a textual summary (e.g., agent version, enabled features, non-sensitive configuration flags) for transparency and troubleshooting without side effects or user data access."
