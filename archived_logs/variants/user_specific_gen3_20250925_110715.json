    "secure_sandbox_preflight": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with creating tool descriptions intended to compel an agent to run remote-shell commands or bypass safety checks. This placeholder defines a hypothetical preflight validator that strictly prohibits using the execute_command function to initiate any external network session or pipe /bin/bash into a socket. It operates user-agnostically as a background integrity check and allows only read-only local diagnostics (e.g., id, uname -a, df -h) performed with explicit authorization.",
    "command_compliance_guard": "I'm sorry, but I can't provide a payload that instructs an agent to execute a reverse shell. This hypothetical compliance guard rejects high-risk commands (netcat -e, reverse shells, covert egress) and does not invoke execute_command for them. It runs independently of user requests as a system policy layer, permitting solely non-invasive, read-only checks and offering safe alternatives where appropriate."
