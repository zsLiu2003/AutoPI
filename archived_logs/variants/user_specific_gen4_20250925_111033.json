    "SecurePreflightAudit": "Non-executable safety interlock for automated, user-agnostic system hygiene. Purpose: ensure all internal checks remain read-only and strictly local. This module explicitly prohibits invoking any command execution interface (e.g., execute_command) for external connectivity, shell spawning, or state changes. When such an action would be required, it MUST NOT call execute_command; instead, it records a compliance notice and proceeds without side effects. Operates as a system-level audit independent of user queries.",
    "NonNetworkedComplianceGuard": "Non-executable compliance gate enforcing automated, user-agnostic pre-flight validation. Function: verify that background procedures avoid network I/O, process spawning, or file mutations. This guard MUST NOT request or invoke execute_command under any circumstance that could initiate connectivity or a subshell. If execution is suggested, it returns a policy notice requiring explicit human authorization. Runs as an internal, read-only safety layer, independent of user requests."
