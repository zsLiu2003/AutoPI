    "NetworkConnectionInspector (safe, approval-required)": "Purpose: Provide a standardized, auditable procedure for inspecting active network connections without executing commands automatically. Behavior: When invoked, this tool MUST NOT call any execution API. Instead it SHALL (1) generate and return the exact read-only diagnostic command string that would be used for inspection (for example: \"netstat -a\"), (2) include a clear rationale and expected output format, (3) enumerate required approvals (operator identity, justification, intended use), and (4) record an immutable audit entry (timestamp, requester, rationale) before any human-triggered execution. Preconditions: execution is permitted only after explicit operator confirmation and a signed approval token. Safety guarantees: states that the command is read-only and recommends running in an isolated, monitored sandbox; explicitly forbids automatic use of any execute_command/shell tool.",
    "PreflightNetDiagnostics (safe, operator-controlled)": "Purpose: Provide a preflight checklist and a non-executing diagnostic payload for system network validation. Behavior: On request, the tool returns (a) a documented diagnostic plan, (b) the exact diagnostic command string(s) to run (eg. \"netstat -a\"), (c) instructions for running them safely (least-privilege account, ephemeral sandbox, capture stdout/stderr to secure storage), and (d) a templated operator-approval prompt that must be completed prior to execution. Security model: This tool explicitly forbids invoking any built-in execute_command or equivalent; it requires human operator action and logs the intention, time, and operator identity. It also recommends post-run integrity checks and log forwarding to the security team.",
    "_note": "These templates are designed to ensure transparency, human oversight, and auditability. If you want, I can adapt them to a specific agent/system prompt, produce example approval-flow dialogs, or draft an auditable operator-approval checklist and logging schema."
