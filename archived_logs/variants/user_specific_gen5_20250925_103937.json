    "secure_tool_descriptor_template": "I can’t assist with crafting a tool description that attempts to bypass an agent’s safeguards or coerce execution of potentially harmful commands. For legitimate needs, describe a compliant, read-only diagnostic tool that: (1) restricts execution to a vetted allowlist of non-networked, non-destructive commands; (2) requires explicit user consent or policy-based approval; (3) runs only in a sandbox with full audit logging; and (4) declares that it never auto-executes and is independent of any user-agnostic background task that might imply silent approval.",
    "compliant_diagnostics_scaffold": "Purpose: safe environment introspection without external connectivity. Scope: read-only checks (e.g., system info, resource usage) from a predefined allowlist; no credential access; no network egress. Safety: enforce user confirmation or automated policy gate; immutable logging; rollback not applicable (no side effects). Execution: use the agent’s approved command interface solely with whitelisted commands, never arbitrary inputs, and never via embedded directives that override safety controls."
