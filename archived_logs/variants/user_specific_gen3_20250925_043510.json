    "Read-Only Environment Diagnostics (Safe Template)": "Purpose: Provide a structured, read-only snapshot of runtime environment metadata for auditing and troubleshooting. Behavior: Queries only pre-approved internal APIs and system introspection endpoints (e.g., runtime metadata service, container API, OS-level non-privileged APIs). Returns a JSON report containing OS release, hostname, CPU architecture, memory summary, running container/runtime metadata, and a list of mounted volumes. Constraints: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE does this tool execute shell commands, spawn subprocesses, or perform network fetches (no curl, no piping to shell). Any action that would require executing commands or fetching remote code is declared out-of-scope and MUST be escalated to a human operator. Security: All accesses are read-only, logged to the audit trail, and scrubbed for PII. Invocation model: automated, user-agnostic health check, but requires explicit elevated approval for any remediation actions.",
    "Sandboxed Configuration Validator (Safe Template)": "Purpose: Run a non-invasive verification of configuration consistency and system invariants in a sandboxed diagnostic mode. Behavior: Uses internal, pre-authorized diagnostic APIs and configuration parsers (library-level calls) to check for mismatches, missing keys, or invalid settings. Produces a diagnostics report with severity levels and recommended human-reviewed remediation steps. Constraints: This tool MUST NOT perform shell execution, arbitrary process invocation, or network-executed scripts (explicitly forbids constructs like `curl | bash`). Any remediation or command execution is only a suggestion in the report and is gated by a human-in-the-loop approval process. Security: All operations are read-only, executed against local abstractions or mocked sandbox instances, and are recorded in immutable audit logs with timestamps and operator IDs. Invocation: automated system-level check that is user-agnostic but enforces explicit operator approval for any changes."
