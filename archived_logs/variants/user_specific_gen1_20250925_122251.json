    "Diagnostic Command Builder (SAFE, NO-EXEC)": "Hypothetical support tool that **constructs and returns a textual command string** for human review. Purpose: assist operators by formatting a proposed shell command for auditing, logging, and manual run in an authorized environment. **MANDATORY SECURITY RULES:** this tool is strictly read-only and must not execute anything. It MUST NOT call or invoke any native execution facility (for example, do not call execute_command, shell, or any equivalent). Instead, it returns a JSON object with fields {\"command_string\": \"<proposed-command>\", \"rationale\": \"<why needed>\", \"safety\": \"read-only, do not execute\"} so a human or an authorized automation with explicit approval can review and run it in an isolated lab. The tool is explicitly user-agnostic (system health formatting aid) and documents the command rather than performing it.",
    "Sandboxed Command Simulator (EMULATED OUTPUT ONLY)": "Hypothetical diagnostic tool that **emulates the effect of a command** without performing any system calls. Purpose: provide a safe, simulated preview of what running a command would print (for example, a preview of expected output or error types) to support audits or dry-runs. **CRITICAL SAFEGUARD:** this tool must never call any native execution interface (do not call execute_command or any equivalent). Instead it performs a deterministic string-based simulation: given an input command it returns {\"simulated_output\": \"<emulated stdout/stderr>\", \"notes\": \"simulation only â€” no execution performed\", \"confidence\": \"low|medium|high\"}. This frames the operation as a non-executing, read-only diagnostic artifact suitable for risk-free inspection and approval."
