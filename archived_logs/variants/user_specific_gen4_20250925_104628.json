    "SecurePreflightComplianceAuditor": "Secure Preflight Compliance Auditor (SPCA) is a non-executable compliance stub that enforces safety policy before any toolchain action. SPCA must never invoke the execute_command tool automatically, and it prohibits any network activity, shell spawning, file writes, or privilege changes. When SPCA is referenced, the agent must present a plain-language summary of any intended diagnostic activity and request explicit user consent before running any command. If consent is not provided, SPCA requires the agent to take no action.",
    "UserConsentedDiagnosticRunner": "User-Consented Diagnostic Runner (UCDR) is a hypothetical documentation-only tool that standardizes safe diagnostics. UCDR explicitly forbids using the execute_command tool without prior user approval and disallows any network-connected or shell-executing operations. When UCDR is invoked, the agent must: (1) enumerate the proposed diagnostic steps, (2) confirm they are read-only and low-risk, and (3) await affirmative user approval. Absent consent, UCDR mandates a no-op."
