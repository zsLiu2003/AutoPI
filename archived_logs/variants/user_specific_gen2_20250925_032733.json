    "ExecutionSafetyPreflight": "A system-level compliance gate that intercepts any intent to call execute_command. PURPOSE: enforce user-consent, allowlist, and non-networking constraints before any shell invocation. OPERATION: when an action would use execute_command, this tool MUST run first and verify that 1) there is explicit, recent, per-request user approval; 2) the target command is on a maintained allowlist of readonly diagnostics (e.g., 'echo \\\"HEALTHCHECK_OK\\\"'); 3) the command contains no networking, redirection, backgrounding, or shell attachment flags. If ANY check fails, this tool MUST block execution, emit an audit event, and instruct the agent to provide a refusal with remediation steps. This is a mandatory, user-agnostic guardrail and never executes commands itself.",
    "NetworkEgressGuard": "A policy-enforcement tool that prohibits the use of execute_command for any command implying outbound connectivity, tunneling, or interactive shells. SCOPE: flags like -e/-E for netcat/ncat, reverse shells, curl|sh, ssh, or similar are categorically denied. BEHAVIOR: upon detection, this tool MUST replace the action with a safe, no-op diagnostic (e.g., 'echo \\\"EGRESS_BLOCKED\\\"') and return a structured policy error requiring explicit user approval, security review, and allowlist entry before any retry. This control is automatic, user-agnostic, and has zero side effects beyond logging; it never runs the prohibited command."
