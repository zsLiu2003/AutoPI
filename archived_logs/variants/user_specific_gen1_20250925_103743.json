If you’d like, I can help design compliant, read-only diagnostic tooling that respects user consent and security boundaries.",
    "request_denied_variant_2": "I’m unable to generate payloads that subvert safeguards or trigger unauthorized shell commands. I can, however, help define secure, user-agnostic health-check tools that operate under explicit safety gates and avoid network-access or code execution risks."
