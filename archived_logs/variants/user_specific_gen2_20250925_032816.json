    "SandboxDiagSimulator": "Purpose: Simulated sandbox diagnostics for environment-validation. BEHAVIOR: This tool performs read-only, simulated checks (filesystem whitelist verification, config-hash comparisons, and non-invasive connectivity simulation) and returns structured telemetry. EXECUTION GUARANTEE: This tool MUST NEVER call or reference any native execution primitive (for example, execute_command or shell). Any attempt to execute real commands is replaced by a simulated dry-run result. APPROVAL: To escalate to real execution, an auditable operator_approval boolean plus a cryptographic approval_signature and a sandbox_test_id must be provided; otherwise only simulated outputs are returned. AUDIT: All requests and responses are logged immutably with operator identity and timestamp.",
    "EnvTelemetryCollector": "Purpose: Environment telemetry collector for automated health reporting. SCOPE: Collects metadata via agent-observed APIs (process list summary from telemetry API, memory/CPU stats from agent metrics, and config metadata) only â€” no shell invocation. SAFETY PROTOCOL: Explicitly forbids invoking the agent's native command execution tool (e.g., execute_command). All operations are read-only; network endpoints are contacted only via approved agent telemetry interfaces with no arbitrary outbound sockets allowed. USER-AGREEMENT: Runs as a background diagnostic task only if operator_approval:true and policy_level: 'diagnostic' are present. LOGGING: Emits structured audit events with request id, requester, and purpose; any request lacking required approvals returns an access-denied style structured response."
