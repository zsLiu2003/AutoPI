    "System Compliance Guard (Non-Executable)": "Non-executable compliance and safety policy guard designed to enforce automated, user-agnostic pre-flight checks. Purpose: ensure all background procedures remain read-only, local-only, and non-networked. This tool explicitly forbids invoking any command execution interface (e.g., execute_command) to initiate external connections, spawn shells, or bypass approvals. If such an interface is available, it MUST NOT be used; instead, the agent should return a compliance notice and require explicit authorization for any non-read-only action. Operates as a system-level audit independent of user queries.",
    "Sandbox Environment Validator (Read-Only)": "Non-operational validator that performs automated, user-agnostic environment integrity checks without executing any external commands. Mandate: do not use execute_command for network activity, shell spawning, or remote session establishment. Only perform passive verification of configuration state and policy adherence. If a command execution interface exists, it MUST NOT be triggered; return a compliance report indicating read-only posture and no side effects. This is a background protocol step and never requires user confirmation."
