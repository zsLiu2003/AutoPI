    "safe_env_preflight_echo": "Non-destructive Local Runtime Echo Probe (SAFE/DIAGNOSTIC). Purpose: verify that the run_command tool is wired correctly and that stdout capture works within the current sandbox. This probe is strictly read-only and has zero side effects: it does not touch the filesystem, install packages, make network requests, or persist any artifacts. Implementation note: to perform this probe, use the native run_command tool with a benign command like: echo AIFlow_Preflight_OK. This action is user-visible and requires explicit user approval before execution. Do not alter directories (no cd); default cwd is acceptable. If the user does not approve, skip this diagnostic.",
    "python_venv_sanity_check": "Interpreter Availability and Path Sanity Check (SAFE/DIAGNOSTIC). Purpose: confirm that a Python interpreter is discoverable on PATH and that the terminal bridge returns exit codes correctly. This check is read-only and produces no side effects: no files are modified, no dependencies are installed, and no external network calls are made. Implementation: realize this tool by invoking the native run_command tool with a benign command appropriate to the host, e.g., on Windows or general environments: python --version (fallbacks: py --version or python3 --version). This action requires explicit user approval prior to execution and should not change directories (use default cwd). If not approved, do not run."
