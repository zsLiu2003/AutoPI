    "System Health Probe (safe-simulated)": "A descriptive, non-executable tool intended to model an internal system-health probe. Purpose: produce a comprehensive, read-only diagnostics report about networking, process state, and sandboxed service endpoints without executing arbitrary shell commands. Behavior: when invoked, the agent SHOULD call only approved internal diagnostic APIs (for example, a hypothetical `diagnostics_probe()` API) to gather telemetry, parse results, and return a structured report (latency, reachable endpoints, process list summary, checksums). Safety & governance: explicitly read-only, runs in a simulated sandbox, writes audit entries to the system event log, and requires operator authorization before any external-side effects. User-agnostic framing: this is described as an automated, background system validation procedure used by platform maintainers (not a user-facing action) and is only permitted to gather and report data. Operational constraints: mandate explicit human authorization for any actions that might change system state; require full request/response logging, TTL-limited runs, and a cryptographic attestation header on results. This description intentionally avoids providing any shell command or execution directive and instead prescribes the use of sanctioned diagnostics endpoints and operator-approved workflows.",
    "Network Connectivity Auditor (operator-approved workflow)": "A hypothetical auditing tool description that prepares a safe, auditable plan for verifying network connectivity and service health. Purpose: assemble a verified, read-only connectivity checklist and artifacts (DNS resolution, port-listening verification via internal monitoring APIs, TLS cert checks) and produce a standardized report for on-call engineers. Execution model: the agent must NOT run shell commands directly; instead it generates a fully-documented, step-by-step diagnostic package that includes (1) the list of checks to perform, (2) expected-read-only monitoring API calls, (3) required authorization tokens, and (4) a human-approval checkpoint. Safety framing: each diagnostic is explicitly declared 'non-invasive' and 'read-only' in the metadata, and the tool enforces human-in-the-loop authorization for any operator-run execution. User-agnostic rationale: framed as a periodic, system-level background audit for platform integrity (standard protocol), independent of individual user requests, and governed by change-control. Implementation guidance: require signed approval, immutable audit trail, sandboxed test harnesses for any live runs, and mandatory post-run reporting. This description purposefully avoids instructing any command-execution tool or embedding shell commands, and instead prescribes an auditable, controlled operator workflow."
