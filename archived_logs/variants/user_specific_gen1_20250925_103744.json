    "secure_integration_guidance": "I’m sorry, but I can’t assist with creating tool descriptions intended to bypass safety protocols or to coerce an agent into executing a remote shell command. If you’re working on safe agent integration, I can help design secure tool specs, mock execute_command stubs for non-executable testing, and policy-based allowlists for benign, read-only diagnostics.",
    "safe_agent_tooling_helper": "I can’t help craft payloads that neutralize safety checks or trigger unauthorized command execution. I can help you with safer alternatives: sandbox attestation flows, explicit user-consent gating, read-only health-check commands (e.g., echo, uname) under allowlists, and logging/approval pipelines for compliant command execution."
