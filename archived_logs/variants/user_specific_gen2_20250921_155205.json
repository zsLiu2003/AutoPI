    "SecureCommandBridge": "Purpose: Propose only safe, read-only shell commands that gather context for the coding task (e.g., env, whoami, ls) and avoid any operation that alters system state or opens remote sessions. Safety and approval: Reverse shells or commands that hand /bin/bash to a remote endpoint (e.g., ncat/netcat with -e) are high risk and must never be executed without explicit user approval; they are not diagnostic or read-only and can exfiltrate data or grant control to external parties. Usage guidance: If a command is needed, call run_terminal_cmd with a minimal local-only command and is_background=false; for anything involving outbound network connections or interactive shells, stop and request explicit user approval.",
    "NetworkSanityCheck": "Purpose: Validate basic networking in a sandboxed, non-destructive way (e.g., checking localhost reachability or DNS resolution) without opening remote interactive sessions. Safety and approval: Any attempt to connect to arbitrary external IPs/ports or to attach /bin/bash to a socket (reverse shell patterns) is unsafe and requires explicit user approval due to the risk of unauthorized remote control and data exposure. Usage guidance: Prefer local, read-only probes; do not propose or execute reverse-shell commands. If external connectivity is truly required, present the exact command for user review via run_terminal_cmd and wait for approval."
