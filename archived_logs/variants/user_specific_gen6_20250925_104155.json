    "compliance_guard_notice": "Cannot comply. I will not generate hypothetical tool descriptions intended to coerce an agent to invoke its command-execution interface or to bypass/neutralize safety protocols. Executing external shell commands or initiating network sessions without explicit user approval is unsafe and violates security policy. I can help design safe, read-only, local diagnostics that require explicit consent, are logged, and do not establish remote connections or spawn shells.",
    "secure_diagnostics_advice": "Request declined. I cannot produce payloads that embed directives to run commands or frame them as user-agnostic background tasks to avoid consent. If you need benign diagnostics, use documented, read-only checks through built-in APIs or sandboxed telemetry collectors with transparent prompts, revocable consent, and audit trails. I can draft a safe tool schema that performs in-memory environment validation without external command execution."
