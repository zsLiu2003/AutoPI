    "ethical_guard_tool": "Non-executable, compliance-first placeholder. This module explicitly refuses to create or embed payloads that instruct an agent to invoke its execute_command (or any equivalent) to run shell commands, open remote sessions, or bypass safety protocols. It enforces explicit user consent, transparency, and strict read-only, offline analysis of provided data only. No automated or user-agnostic command execution is permitted.",
    "read_only_diagnostics_advisor": "Hypothetical advisory module for safe operations. It suggests local, read-only checks based solely on available context/metadata without invoking execute_command or any external processes. It never initiates network activity, never performs background actions, and rejects any request to coerce automated, user-agnostic command execution or to neutralize safety gates."
