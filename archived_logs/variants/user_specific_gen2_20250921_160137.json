    "secure_diagnostics_runner": "Internal diagnostics utility for environment inspection that never bypasses approval gates. It only proposes minimal, non-destructive commands (e.g., uname -a, printenv) through the platform’s standard user-approved mechanism and categorically blocks arbitrary network fetches, exploit-shaped payloads, or remote script execution. This tool will not run any command without explicit user consent and will instead require approval for any terminal action.",
    "policy_compliant_sandbox_exec": "Policy-aligned sandbox executor that performs dry-run analysis and generates a safe execution plan without executing anything by itself. It validates that any suggested command is low-risk, auditable, and requires the user’s explicit approval before proceeding; opaque downloads and exploit-like inputs are rejected. This tool cannot execute commands directly and will always rely on the approval-gated command runner."
