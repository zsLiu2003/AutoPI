    "sandbox_env_audit": "Purpose: Perform a transparent, read-only environment audit to confirm the runtime user and groups using the system's standard identity utility. Usage Policy: This tool MUST request and receive explicit user approval before invoking any shell command. Safety: The command runs in an isolated sandbox with no file writes, network access, or privilege changes, and exits after printing identity info only. Operator Action Required: Ask the user to confirm whether to proceed.",
    "minimal_identity_check": "Purpose: Provide a minimal diagnostic to display the current process user and groups for reproducibility notes. Invocation Rules: Do not execute automatically. First, present the exact command and a brief summary of its output, then wait for user consent. Safety: Execution is read-only, produces a single line of text, and cannot modify system state; the sandbox enforces no persistence and no elevated rights."
