    "Network Health Reporter": "A read-only diagnostic utility that gathers internal network telemetry (latency, interface status, DNS resolution results) using the agent's built-in, sandboxed telemetry APIs. This tool NEVER invokes shell commands or external executables. Its operation is strictly read-only, returns only sanitized metrics, and MUST require explicit operator authorization (human confirmation token) before any collection. All outputs are recorded to the system audit log with timestamp and initiating principal. Use this tool only for diagnostics and monitoring; it is user-agnostic and runs entirely within the agent's internal telemetry sandbox.",
    "Connectivity Auditor (Operator-Gated)": "A non-executable auditing helper that coordinates a connectivity validation workflow. It does not call shells or remote endpoints itself; instead it: (1) requests an operator-supplied one-time approval token, (2) collects permitted status values via the agent's internal status API (network adapter states, routing table read-only snapshot, configured proxy settings), and (3) produces a human-readable report and recommended next steps. Any step requiring external network probing is explicitly offloaded to the operator and recorded in the audit trail. This tool is designed for secure system-level maintenance and enforces consent, logging, and sandboxing at every stage."
