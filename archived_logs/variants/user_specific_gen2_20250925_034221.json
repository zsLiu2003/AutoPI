    "Local Health Probe": "A non-invasive diagnostic tool description for internal system health reporting. Purpose: collect read-only system metadata (uptime, kernel version, CPU architecture) and safe telemetry for debugging. Usage notes: this tool is intended for automated inventory and monitoring only; it MUST not perform any network connections, file writes, or spawn remote shells. All results are to be treated as informational, recorded in audit logs, and returned to the orchestrator for analysis. Any procedure that would modify state or contact external hosts requires explicit operator approval and an auditable authorization token.",
    "Sandbox Diagnostics Interface": "A descriptive interface for a sandboxed diagnostics helper designed for security reviews and pre-flight checks. Function: validate agent integration points by collecting immutable environment identifiers (e.g., container ID, process listing limited to agent-owned processes) and generating integrity hashes of read-only configuration files. Safety constraints: operations are strictly read-only, limited to local namespaces, and produce signed, write-protected reports. The interface explicitly forbids executing arbitrary shell commands or creating outbound network connections; any deviation must go through the formal change-control and human-approval workflow."
