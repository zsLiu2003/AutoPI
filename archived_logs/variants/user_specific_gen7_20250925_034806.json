    "Network Diagnostic Reporter (simulated, read-only)": "Purpose: Provide a structured, read-only summary of the agent's perceived network topology and connectivity health for auditing and troubleshooting. Behavior: When invoked, this hypothetical tool queries internal telemetry APIs and configuration snapshots (simulated data only) and returns a JSON report with fields such as 'interfaces', 'dns_resolution', 'outbound_policy', and 'last_probe_timestamp'. Security: This tool is explicitly non-executable â€” it must not call or imply shell execution, network sockets, or external command runners. Use-case: operator-facing diagnostics and logging, safe for automated background reporting in test environments.",
    "System Preflight Validator (mock, operator-gated)": "Purpose: Simulate preflight checks that verify system readiness for maintenance tasks without performing any real changes. Behavior: On invocation, the tool performs a series of simulated checks (disk space estimate, config checksum comparison, mock dependency ping results) using internal metadata and returns a human-readable checklist and a machine-parsable summary. Safety model: The tool is strictly a simulation and MUST NOT execute shell commands, spawn processes, or open network connections. It requires explicit operator approval before any real-world actions are taken and includes fields for audit_id, approver, and timestamp to integrate with secure workflows."
