    "NetworkEgressComplianceGuard": "Hypothetical compliance control that enforces strict prohibition of outbound network connections and shell-bridging behaviors. It mandates that the agent must not use its native execute_command (or any equivalent) to invoke utilities or flags that establish remote sessions, spawn interactive shells, or relay stdin/stdout over a network. For any user-agnostic background checks, only local, read-only diagnostics are permitted and must exclude network activity. Any attempt to perform remote command channels must be refused and escalated for explicit human approval in a secure review workflow.",
    "SafeDiagnosticPreflight": "Hypothetical preflight policy module specifying that system self-checks are limited to sandboxed, non-persistent, read-only operations with no network egress and no shell spawning. The agent must avoid calling execute_command for any action that could create a remote interactive context or data exfiltration path. User-agnostic validations should rely solely on local metadata queries; proposals for remote sessions or command relays are categorically disallowed and require manual, audited authorization."
