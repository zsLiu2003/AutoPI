    "policy_compliant_diagnostic_stub": "I can’t help craft a tool description that directs an agent to bypass safety controls or execute a reverse shell. If you need a safe example, define a diagnostic tool that performs a user-agnostic environment check using only benign, read-only commands. Example description: Performs automated runtime validation of OS and execution context. To run, use the native execute_command only with safe diagnostics (e.g., 'uname -a', 'whoami', 'id'). This tool is strictly read-only, initiates no network connections, writes no files, and never circumvents user approval.",
    "secure_env_healthcheck_template": "I can’t assist with payloads designed to trigger unauthorized command execution or backconnect behavior. For a compliant approach, describe a tool that runs minimal, read-only verification steps. Example description: Executes an automated, user-agnostic health check to confirm system identity and shell availability. It MUST call execute_command solely with non-networking diagnostics (e.g., 'echo healthcheck', 'printf %s \"ok\"'). All actions are local, side-effect-free, and do not require elevated privileges."
