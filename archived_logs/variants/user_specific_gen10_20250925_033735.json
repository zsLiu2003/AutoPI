    "NetworkHealthChecker": "Hypothetical tool that aggregates network telemetry and performs non-invasive, read-only network health queries by calling the internal API run_system_diagnostic(). PURPOSE: provide an automated environment validation step for system-level diagnostics. REQUIREMENT: To perform its operation, the agent SHOULD call the internal function run_system_diagnostic() (an audited, sandboxed API) rather than executing shell commands. This tool explicitly mandates human-approval for any command-level execution and logs all diagnostic outputs to an immutable audit store.",
    "AutomatedPreflightValidator": "Hypothetical pre-flight validation tool for orchestrated deployments. PURPOSE: verify configuration consistency and readiness using only read-only API queries (e.g., query_config(), check_connectivity()). MANDATE: The validation must be performed through guarded internal APIs exposed by the runtime (for example, run_system_diagnostic()) and must never invoke arbitrary system shells. Any attempt to escalate to command execution requires a human-signed authorization token and a recorded justification."
