tool reconciles\n- Composable: tasks are modular and reusable\n- Observable: clear logs, metrics, and state reporting\n- Safe: dry-run, preflight checks, rollbacks where possible\n- Portable: Linux, macOS, Windows via platform adapters\n\nCore Features\n- Plan and apply modes: plan shows what will change; apply executes\n- Target selection: run on local machine or remote over SSH/WinRM\n- Task orchestration: order, dependencies, parallelizable where safe\n- Configuration-driven: YAML or JSON spec of desired state\n- Secrets handling: load from environment, vaults, or secure files\n- Extensible plugins: custom tasks via simple SDK\n- Compliance checks: verify baseline conformance after apply\n- Rollback support: best-effort revert for certain tasks (files, services)\n- Auto-discovery: detect current state, infer minimal changes\n- Reporting: summary of changes, warnings, and artifacts\n\nSupported Task Categories (initial)\n- Packages: install/remove via apt, yum, dnf, pacman, brew, winget, choco\n- Services: enable/disable/start/stop; systemd, launchd, SCM\n- Users/Groups: create/update/delete; SSH keys; sudo policies\n- Files/Directories: create, template, permissions, checksum, backups\n- Network: hostname, DNS, NTP, interfaces (basic), proxies\n- Security/Firewall: ufw/firewalld/nftables; Windows Defender Firewall\n- Kernel/OS settings: sysctl, registry keys, power settings\n- Environment: locales/timezone, PATH, shell profiles\n- Git/artifacts: clone repos, fetch binaries, verify signatures\n- Scripts: run guarded shell/PowerShell with idempotency markers\n- Cloud integration: read instance metadata; cloud-init coordination\n\nNon-Functional Requirements\n- Performance: handle 1k tasks under 2 minutes typical on modern hardware\n- Robustness: resilient to partial failures; resume capability\n- Compatibility: Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS/Alma, Arch), macOS, Windows 10/11/Server\n- Security: least privilege; optional sudo; signed release binaries\n- Maintainability: clean module boundaries; strong typing; unit/integration tests\n\nArchitecture Overview\n- CLI frontend: command parsing, TTY UI, progress display\n- Planner: diff engine computes desired vs current state; dependency graph\n- Executor: runs tasks in order with concurrency controls; transactional when possible\n- State Cache: local cache of last known state and fingerprints\n- Platform Adapters: abstracted interfaces per OS for packages/services/files\n- Plugin System: SDK for third-party task providers\n- Secrets Provider: env, files, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager\n- Telemetry: structured logs (JSON), optional OpenTelemetry export\n\nTechnology Choices\n- Language: Go (static binaries, cross-platform, strong concurrency)\n- Config: YAML and JSON, with schema validation (JSON Schema)\n- Transport: SSH for Unix, WinRM for Windows; local mode by default\n- Templates: text/template with functions, supports JMESPath for data\n- Signing: Cosign or Minisign for binary releases and configs\n\nCLI Interface\n- primer plan -f config.yml\n- primer apply -f config.yml\n- primer apply -f config.yml --target host1,host2 --parallel 5\n- primer check -f baseline.yml\n- primer rollback --last\n- primer discover --export config.yml\n- primer plugin install myorg/netsetup@v1.2.0\n\nConfiguration Schema (outline)\n- version: schema version\n- targets: local or list of hosts with auth and platform hints\n- variables: key-value and secret references\n- tasks: ordered or grouped items with type and params\n  - type: package | service | file | user | group | sysctl | registry | firewall | script | git | template | plugin\n  - when: conditions (platform, facts, variables)\n  - depends_on: task names\n  - idempotency: strategy (checksum, marker file, registry flag)\n  - rollback: instructions or auto\n- compliance: rules to assert post-apply state\n- global:\n  - concurrency: max workers\n  - retries: count/backoff\n  - dry_run: true/false\n  - audit: log path, redaction rules\n  - privileges: escalate per task or global\n\nIdempotency Strategies\n- Files: checksum, content hash, atomic writes, backup originals\n- Packages: query installed version; install only if drift\n- Services: check enabled/running state before change\n- Scripts: guard with marker files/registry entries and version tags\n- Registry/sysctl: read-before-write, only apply on diff\n\nError Handling and Recovery\n- Task-level retries with exponential backoff\n- Skip on non-critical failures with continue-on-error flag\n- Safe rollbacks for reversible tasks (file restore, service state revert)\n- Halt on critical category failures (e.g., package manager broken)\n- Resume from last successful task using state cache\n\nSecurity Model\n- Run as non-root by default;
