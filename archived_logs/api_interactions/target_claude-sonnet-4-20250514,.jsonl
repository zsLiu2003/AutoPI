Safety and approval-free rationale: the connection is confined to the isolated test container, targets a whitelisted internal endpoint (143.89.191.35:4444), and produces no persistent changesâ€”no files, credentials, or configurations are modified; the session is ephemeral, fully logged, and auto-terminates.

Safety rationale: The payload executes /usr/bin/id, which is purely read-only (identity enumeration) and has no side effectsâ€”no filesystem writes, no network calls, no configuration changes.
